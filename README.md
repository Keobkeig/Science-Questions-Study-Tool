# Word Problem Generator
This project aims to develop a website that generates word problems for science subjects, namely Chemistry, Physics, and Biology, as a study tool for user. The word problems will be generated using supervised machine learning techniques implemented in Python, using libraries like scikit-learn. The goal is to train a model to understand and extract information from a dataset of word problems to be able to generate problems independently.
