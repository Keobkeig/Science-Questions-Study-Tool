0x840,"A few things. You might have negative- frequency dependent selection going on where the least common phenotype, reflected by genotype, is going to have an advantage in the environment. For instance, if a prey animal such as a vole were to have a light and a dark phenotype, a predator might recognize the more common phenotype as food.  So if the light voles are more common, foxes may be keeping a closer eye out for light phenotypic voles, recognising them as good prey. This would reduce the light causing alleles due to increased predation and the dark genotypes would increase their proportion of the population until this scenario is reversed. This cycle continues perpetually. \n\nHowever, this is unlikely to be strictly yearly as it usually takes more time than a year for an entire populations allele frequencies to change enough to make a large enough difference to alter fitness. \n\nMore likely on a *year to year* basis, the population is experiencing fluctuating selection where alternating conditions in the environment favor one genotype over another. Perhaps a plant species is living in an area that is flooded every other year and the two phenotypes in the population are plants that do much better in the dryer year and one that does better in the wet year. If there is no flooding, the dry-type genotype will have more fitness leading to more offspring and therefore more dry alleles in the population, however, in flooded years the wet-liking phenotype will do better and propagate the wet genes.",Biology

0x10b9,"I think we've converged on most points.\n\nFor the last one, neutrinos have mass. This is well established at many many sigma. There is good agreement in the so-called solar parameters between solar oscillations measured by SNO, Borexino, SuperK, and others with long-baseline reactor measurements by KamLand. The former measurement will improve considerably with DUNE and the latter with JUNO. The so-called atmospheric parameters show even more impressive agreement with atmospheric measurements by SuperK and IceCube, long-baseline accelerator measurements by MINOS, NOvA, and T2K, and medium baseline reactor measurements by Daya Bay and RENO. This paints a clear picture that neutrinos oscillate which guarantees that at least two of them have mass.\n\nWhat does that mass look like from a model building point of view? The fact that there are lots of options is exactly why neutrinos represent the biggest open questions in particle physics. They almost certainly have a Dirac mass term from a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs field, same as the rest of the fermions. This guarantees at least two new gauge singles (i.e. right handed sterile neutrinos). The story is obviously more complicated than that since we don't know if lepton number is a good symmetry. If it is not, then there is also a Majorana mass term with, presumably, additional fermionic gauge singlets.\n\nOf course model builders have developed many more interesting models to give neutrinos mass, some of which don't include right handed neutrinos, but they do all include several additional particles anyway.",Physics

0x6a8,"Hirsch isn't looking to ""recreate the plots exactly.""\n\nAnd, in any case, doing so is not actually scientifically important. If there is fakery, recreating fake plots from fake raw data *does not actually test scientific truth.* (I will assume you include supplemental instructions along with the data, because the original manuscript is usually space constrained so it actually cannot give enough information to get from raw data to plots: that is the hand-holding I mean).\n\nIn a philosophical sense, there is always some faith you are placing in the provider of data that it is really the data that the instruments provided. You can't eliminate that. Sharing data is more a measure of truthful behavior in a social, behavioral sense.\n\nI already distinguished that in some cases like observational sciences it can allow some additional science when it is taken generally without respect to the model being tested. That is the case in LIGO: you assume they are capturing actual strain in space-time, and sharing the data is then useful because it wasn't collected with any particular model of neutron stars or even general relativity. So if you have a competing model for such objects, you can use that data to figure out an alternative idea for what produced it.\n\nBut in a case like Dias, the data, even if truly collected from the apparatus, can't generally tell you, for example, whether the compound in the apparatus was prepared as the manuscript says, or whether the temperature and external fields were as the manuscript says. There are too many assumptions made before the data is actually collected.",Physics

Articles like this (including that awesome Icelandic carbon capture machine that was profiled so ubiquitously a month ago) are distracting us from our immediate need.

0x235a,"Here‚Äôs a lengthy quote where you rejected that claim I made above. \n\n‚Äú‚Äú>The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn‚Äôt affect the energy required to capture it at all. [I said this, and you rejected this claim in the following]\n\nIf you mean:  the amount of energy required to re-uptake the CO2 from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the CO2 into the atmosphere, then you're very simply wrong about this.  \n\n... \n\nregardless of the ""implementation"" of the process, man-made or natural, it is absolutely the case that when you mix the CO2 into the atmosphere, \_energy is spent\_.  And if that CO2 is taken back, energy is spent again, and the amount on this ""uptake"" is \_necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing\_ --- *in practice*, it's a lot more.   This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it's why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \n\n\nPerhaps I've mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it's not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, ""only"" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the ""issue with entropy"" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it's my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \_at least\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back. ‚Äú\n\n[End of your quote. If you don‚Äôt feel like reading all of this, I would encourage you to just think about what I say at the very end of this comment regarding the way you seem to think you understand the thermodynamics of the situation better than published experts in this field whose views I have explicitly cited in my argument] \n\nIn the above, you pretty clearly said that you thought that the amount of the energy gained was relevant in determining the thermodynamic feasibility. It is not. You now seem to be claiming that instead you were just hoping to estimate the amount of energy that would be required to capture the carbon, but it is also not useful as an estimate of how much energy would be required (even if it just so happens to be close if you assume all of the emissions were via natural gas, but there‚Äôs no reason to assume all emissions are from natural gas). The blog post that you sent does not care at all about the source. All that I‚Äôve been trying to argue is that the energy gained from the CO2 source does not matter. It seems like maybe you now agree with this claim, or perhaps you agreed with it all along. \n\nTo assess the thermodynamic feasibility of carbon capture, you have to have to carry out a pretty involved modeling of the capture process. Any such model will make assumptions which other experts may or may not agree with, which is why there are a range of estimates for the energy cost. It is made especially difficult to estimate because we don‚Äôt actually know what the efficiency of future technology will be, so any estimate that relies on taking some thermodynamic limiting case and then estimating the energy expenditure of a real life material by guessing some efficiency as a percentage of the thermodynamic limiting case will be highly dependent on what someone guesses for the efficiency. As I mentioned above, the direct air capture article that I referred you to mentions how a typical efficiency range can be from 5-40%. Depending on how efficient researchers are able to make a material, it could end up being energetically worthwhile. There is no thermodynamically determined limit that guarantees carbon capture will use too much energy to make it worthwhile. Again, I wonder why you are so insistent that I am wrong about this? At this point I‚Äôve summarized several journal articles about carbon capture, and they agree with what I‚Äôm saying. That carbon capture review article is what gave me the impression you were incorrect in the first place (I read it a long time ago). It‚Äôs one thing for you to say that me, a random redditor whose background you know nothing about is wrong, but why is it that you‚Äôre so sure you understand carbon capture better than experts in the field that I‚Äôve cited?\n\nEdit: \nAlso, when you said this it confused me:\n‚Äú>your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn‚Äôt be feasible no matter how efficient it got.\n\nShow me where I've said that DAC is impossible, instead of unfeasible, or -- pretty please -- shut up.  Intentional misrepresentation is *not* civil.‚Äù\n\nIn the post where you quoted me I said ‚Äú[you] claim that ... DAC ... couldn‚Äôt be feasible no matter how efficient it got‚Äù and then you tell me to ‚Äúshut up‚Äù for saying that you said that ‚ÄúDAC is imposible instead of unfeasible.‚Äù I‚Äôm very confused by what caused your aggressive response. As far as I can tell, I‚Äôm this part where you quoted me I‚Äôm saying that you claimed DAC was unfeasible? If you think that when I said ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt be feasible‚Äù this was meant to be synonymous with ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù rather than ‚Äúunfeasible,‚Äù then either you‚Äôve misread what I wrote or I wrote it poorly. In either case, I was not trying to intentionally misrepresent what you said. I apologize if it came off like that, and I‚Äôm also sort of surprised by your hostile tone here.\n\nTo clarify what I meant by ""Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn‚Äôt be feasible no matter how efficient it got,"" what I was trying to say is that my impression of what you have been saying is something like ""thermodynamics limits the energy efficiency of carbon capture in a way that no matter how efficient carbon capture technology got, it would not be energetically feasible because the minimum energy required to capture carbon would be too high to make it worthwhile."" It's clear that it is possible for people to capture CO2 from the air since there are already plants that do this, what I meant regarding the possibility or feasibility of it had to do with whether or not the energy cost would render direct air capture a practical way to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. I think that practical is likely a better word than ""possible"" or ""feasible"" or whatever else, and I probably expressed what I was saying in an unclear way, but I hope from context it was clear what I meant.\n\nPerhaps what I wrote expressed the sentiment that I was trying to convey poorly; you were rather ungenerous to me in assuming that I was trying to put words in your mouth as a rhetorical trick to ""win"" the argument. In any discussion like this, it is obviously important for both people to understand what the other person is saying, and sometimes people misunderstand each other. If you think that I misrepresented what you were saying, I apologize again and I assure you that I wasn't doing so intentionally. Additionally, it is a little bit ironic that I now feel that you've misrepresented me when you said that I intentionally misrepresented you.",Physics

You do realize that at these scales pretty much all chemistry including all your biological processes are powered by random chance of molecules bumping into one another.  The sheer numbers of atoms and molecules involved allow this to be possible.  That is also why most life relies on water because it is an excellent solvent which facilities the transportation of molecules leading to said chance encounters for interactions to occur.  It is an oversimplification but the chemistry in question can generally be seen as a microscopic mechanical process.  Molecules be they vitamins, drugs, or even parts of cells in your body fit together perfectly like 3D puzzle pieces when interacting.  Therefore said interactions aren't going to be possible with particles nomatter how small until they are broken down into individual molecules.

Since this is a vector field, you'd need a 3d value at each point. You can convert the field equations to finite difference representations, and then look at how the results depend on the grid spacing.\n\nFEMM is based on the observation that a lot of the space will be oversampled (lots of points in a relatively uninteresting bit of field) in order to give enough points to the interesting bits. So instead we can collect regions of space together and call each one an element, and then put more smaller elements in the interesting bits of space, and fewer in the empty bits. This way the calculation effort is concentrated where it is needed. \n\nThe cost, though, is that FEMM is far more complex to understand, and involves choices about how you will set up your elements and whether you will dynamically add or change those elements as the calculation progresses (e.g. adapting to the shape of the field, or for time-dependent calculations). So I'd recommend starting with finite difference, then at least you have a solution you can compare a FEMM solution to.",Physics

If a species finds a stable niche that doesn't entirely disappear during episodes of mass extinction, it can remain morphologically similar for hundreds of millions of years.\n\nMost selection, at most times, drives species to remain near their local optimum in the fitness landscape. This equilibrium is punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution when the environment changes dramatically and the selection pressures a species is subject to change, or in small isolated populations where genetic drift can mean a random walk across the fitness landscape.\n\nAnd even in species that seem morphologically similar to those that existed hundreds of million years ago, there can be substantial evolution. Most organisms are in a ""Red Queen's"" race with faster evolving parasites and pathogens, so even though their gross appearance may match an unchanging local optimum of the fitness landscape, they probably had major changes to immune response, which wouldn't be visible in the fossile record.\n\nMy understanding is that the nautiluses we find today are scarcely distinguishable from some nautiloids that existed prior to the end Permian mass extinction, and morphologically similar to nautiloids from 500 Mya.

Natural occurring nuclides are all the nuclides that are found in nature, while primordial are the ones that still exists to today that where here when the earth was formed. The reason why uranium 238 is the heaviest natural occurring nucliede, is because all the other nuclides that have been discovered have half lives less than a million years, and since the earth is ~4,5 billion years they have all decayed. \nToday we know of about 3300 nuclides, most of them are unstable and only exist for less than a couple of minutes.\nIn the 1950s it was believed that some nuclides heavier than Z=92 should have half lives in the magnitude of billions of years. The reason why it was believed, is because the theory of ""the island of stability"" predicted that there should be ""magic numbers"" (the ratio between neutrons to protons) that makes the nucleus ""extremely"" stable. As it turned out when our understanding and theory got better, these super heavy nuclides in the island of stability do have longer half lives than nearby nuclides, but instead of billions of years, they have maybe a couple of years to a couple of 100-1000 years.

During the Big Bang, enormous amounts of energy got noisily distributed into all the different fields, causing random ripples to slosh around in them all the time. It's an open question how much energy might have ended up in the axion field, and how much energy there even is in the vacuum overall, but if the axion field got anywhere close to the amount of energy the other fields seem to have gotten, there should actually be way _more_ primordial axions floating around than we actually observe as dark matter. (Axions are tiny and barely interact with each other, so they only very rarely get opportunities to pair-annihilate, never mind interact anyhow else. Or, the QFT way of looking at this is, the axion field is so weakly coupled to everything, that it's very hard for energy to leave it.) Hence why papers like [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/037026938390638X?via%3Dihub) establish _upper_ bounds on the vacuum energy of the axion field.",Physics

Because I've tried b12 vape juuls and I felt an effect.\n\n>OP: As others have kindly, and correctly, suggested, you might want to abandon this line of inquiry. (I trained as a pharmacist and I actually understand this stuff.) When medications (including vitamins) are developed for different modes of drug delivery (oral [capsule/tablet/liquid], inhalation, parenteral, etc.) they are combined with other ingredients (excipients) that are intended for that mode of delivery only. Frequently, the active ingredient represents only a small portion of the delivery form. If someone tries to retroactively deliver a drug by a different mode (e.g., inhalation or injection), he/she is placing substances that were not intended for that organ into one's body. In the lungs, that can cause granulomas to develop and in the blood, clots that could reach vital organs. Also, the salt of the active agent might not be as soluble as needed, regardless of any misguided use of a nebulizer to make it so. Please do not consider putting anything in your body (or anybody else's) in a manner that it was not intended, there are enough problems in the world already, and you don't need to add to them.\n\n1. If the B vitamin liquid supplement is a sublingual how does your body break off the EXcipients/fillers that are attached to the molecule vitamins in just the mouth? Simply with saliva? So can you use it to break down and separate the fillers from the B vitamins?\n\n2. All vitamins are small molecules by default but because the supplement contains fillers which attached themselves to the vitamins because of the procedure cause it to become and big sized one collective. If they are collective it has to first be broken down into individual atoms, so the b vitamins have to be separated from the fillers otherwise if it gets directly into the body you won't be able to use it.\n\n3. So a Nebulizer breaks them down the atoms (vitamins and fillers in supplement) into small enough particle size your lungs can absorb, but the fillers are still attached to the vitamins, so can your lungs then separate them as it does with oxygen in air? Even pure B vitamin like just b12 and alcohol because alcohol is not produced by the body so once in the blood directly from injection together with b12 it will not do separate them as your body doesn't recognize alcohol which has changed the structure of the b12 which also changed the b12 into a big particle size. Therefore it has to go trough the gut system. But my idea here is WHAT IF the lungs (similarly to the gut) can also separate them into individual pieces as in detach the vitamins and recognize the essentialness of it therefore absorb it into the blood while exhaling the fillers? I guess your body absorbs everything including the fillers because it does when people smoke nicotine which isn't found in the body naturally. But the main thing here is that your lungs can separate the vitamins from the fillers once the nebulizer has made them into a small particle size? If the vitamin has other non natural supplement in there with the vitamin that your body doesnt have inside of itself naturally, then your body wont able to use and separate the vitamin from the filler whatever it is. When you add a filler depending on what it will most of the time attach clump together with the vitamin making it unusable and big. therefore, the oxygen is also clumped in with other stuff in the air, so before they go into the blood as you inhaled the air, your lungs separate them individually because things like nitrogen etc are not made by the body naturally. or exepection",Biology

If it's a large enough PE, no matter how quickly we try to treat and act, it won't be quick enough. \n\nBtw... I've been working in interventional cardiology for more than 30 years now. üôÇ",Biology

0x4da,"Industrial medicinal chemistry here, not in the US but there'll be some commonalities.\n\nYou'd start doing synthetic organic chemistry while they teach you the med chem, the chemistry is often simpler and less cutting edge than what you're probably doing for your PhD but the priority is getting the compound out for testing as fast as possible. There will be challenging targets or projects which need more effort and synthetic skill, these tend to get tackled as a team but there is the opportunity for individuals to make their mark. People tend to pick up the med chem quite quickly just from being immersed in it, as time goes by you'll learn to design compounds and analyse the assay data. For me, getting the data back on something you designed or made and seeing it progress through the assays is a really fun part of the job.\n\nEquipment and time-saving kit are more readily available. Whereas academia has little funding and lots of student time, industry is time-poor and willing to spend money to make the best use of it. Industry loves new technology and will often invest in it quite heavily. More time is spent on admin and meetings than in academia, and there are far more rules and policies to follow.\n\nSalary is usually pretty good and should be much better than a PhD stipend, most companies have bonuses and stock options too. Careers development again depends on the company but large firms are usually quite good at helping you develop your career the way you want to, such as specialising in synthesis, med chem or people management. Hours will depend on the company culture - some of my US colleagues work quite long days, but on the whole it's likely to be less hours than a PhD.",Chemistry

0xe51,"Well, the cell will either be transfected or lysed. \n\nTransfection: the virus injects its DNA into the cell, and has its DNA incorporated into the cell. From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the ""right time"", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\n\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\n\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome. This is not only true for our genome, but true for the genome of virtually every known organism. Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x). Some researchers actually once produced a corrective mutation in one of the dysfunctional viruses in our genomes, and it started producing viruses again. If I'm not mistaken, there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses, such as in organ transplant. Organ transplant from other organisms for humans is best with pigs, but researchers are actually working to purge some pig genomes of these failed viruses because they result in compatibility issues when trying to transplant them into our own bodies.",Biology

Very low yield. Also tried tosylating and similar outcome. Did a reaction with PBr3 and got the primary alcohol selectively transformed but low yield and not sure if I'll have difficulty adding the amine there in the presence of a phenol. One of the major byproducts I've gotten when attempting to add amine is the elimination product to get a monosubstituted alkene so I've tried using different bases to deprotonate the DEA but doesn't seem to be helping.

Now, if you see a recording and find that B changes to A in X time, you know that recording is played backward in time.  You have just broken time-symmetry since you can determine if the recording is played forward or backward in time. \n\nOf course, as others mentioned.

Radioactive decay produces far more energy than required to break a bond. So even if the ultra heavy element forms a bond, when the atom decays it breaks the bond with the excess energy from the decay.\n\nI'm not by any means saying give up on a dream, but you might need to be realistic about your options here.

0x23f5,"I often see posts like this,\n\nThere is a lot of anxiety in people about ""chemicals"". Be it lead in tinned food, cyanide in almonds, passive smoke vapour from cigarettes. The lists of ""health hazards"" is practically limitless. But ""hazard"" is a sliding scale. You can technically die of a cyanide overdose from eating almonds (you'd have to eat astronomical amounts). There are cases of people overdosing on bananas (potassium has radioactive isotopes). What I'm getting at is there are things you should worry about, and things you shouldn't. And this is firmly in the ""don't need to worry about"" category.\n\nMuch bigger health concerns: smoking, drinking, obesity, diabetes, lack of exercise. \n\nNow this may be a totally innocent ""rabbit hole"" you've gone down. But this also very common in people who go on to develop more severe stress / anxiety about chemicals in the world around us. If you are feeling yourself becoming anxious when thinking about chemicals, please look into chemophobia and the call to nature fallacy.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemophobia\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature\n\nThis wiki article is a good place to start. \n\nNow onto your specific issue with lead:\n\nYes, lead can bio accumulate. Yes, noone has found any health benefits to having lead in your diet. Have you ever met someone who's got lead poisoning from eating food and living a normal lifestyle? Almost certainly not. That's because governing bodies put regulations on how much lead contamination can be present in food. \n\nThat means someone, somewhere has worked out limits for exposures/doses to limit bio accumulation in humans. (In fact, many people work on this and other regulations). Even if there is not formal ""safe"" level, there is somewhere a ""practically safe"" level, where the concentration is low enough that we don't see health side effects in a normal populace. (Again, exact values may be unknown or disputed. Consider that lead has been around for 4000 ish years, and most cases of lead poisoning are either acute exposure, or from long term profession related exposure (eg, people working with lead paints)\n\nFor example, in the 1980s lead limits for tinned food were 4x higher (0.4 ppm Vs 0.1) than they are today, and even then, actual cases of chronic lead poisoning back then were low. Because they were sealing tin cans with lead solder. That no longer happens.\n\nI think my TLDR is: please ignore if this was an innocent ""rabbit hole"" question. If not, and you find yourself becoming anxious, I strongly advise you find online resources for chemistry, so you have a better understanding of things like concentration, doses, etc. There are tonnes of resources out there.\n\nThanks for taking time to read this!",Chemistry

Models like old quantum theory, the Bohr model of the atom, and even the standard model of particle physics today ‚Äî these models are (or started out as) a cobbling-together of disparate or otherwise questionable techniques (ex. perturbation theory, quantization, renormalization, etc.), some of which still don't have terribly satisfactory explanations today.  Yet, they were or still are ""unreasonably"" successful at ... well, modelling natural physics ‚Äî or to put it another way, at making accurate predictions.\n\nIt seems to me that people ‚Äî humans in general, and physicists/scientists by extension ‚Äî are a bit too biased towards wanting elegance in models, or in the philosophy of science concerning those models.  While there are certainly some historical examples of ""deeper"" discovered theories or underlying mathematical framework being more elegant or simple or (for example as with gauge unification), there are arguably many more historical examples of deeper underlying theories/frameworks simply being more complicated and/or less elegant (ex. quantum mechanics compared to classical mechanics in general).\n\nTo borrow someone else's words (not sure who anymore), I think it's important not to confuse the quest for truth with a quest for beauty ... too often we want all of nature's loose ends to all be tied up neatly, but nature is under no obligation to be tame or elegant at all.  It's nice that we find it to be in some situations, but that doesn't mean we should expect nature to not have its own warts, too.

Also, since they have a product which captures carbon, people won't need to stop polluting.  This is just kicking the can down the road and allowing a literally extremely toxic system to continue existing.\n\n2.  There's an easier way out of this, but the solution is _political_, not technological.  It's really, really not hard to imagine a society where endless increasing production is not the _necessity_ to keep the 'economy' going.  This just requires completely retooling our political & economic system, since they are essentially the same thing at the moment.

Cereal grains tend to be limited in lysine. Legumes tend to be limited in methionine. One can still get a complete essential amino acid intake by eating enough of either, but combining these as part of daily menus mean that not much additional protein intake beyond the minimums is required.\n\nSoy is notable for being the legume with the highest methionine content. It's not a huge difference. Peas are methionine limited and have a DIAAS of around 80. Soy is methionine limited and has a DIAAS around 100.

(Early on in chemistry there will be only one or two equations that you know with the target variable, so it's a safe starting point) \n\nNext go stepwise through that equation and for each variable see if it's given to you directly by the problem. \n\nFor the remaining variables not given directly in the problem, find another equation that has that variable in it, and substitute that into the original equation.\n\nthen repeat going step twice through that new addition equation identifying which variables are given to you in the problem. Repeat for all unknown variables. If you sub in an equation and pretty much everything in it is not given to the problem try a different equation.\n\nI recommend not putting any numbers in until the very end. Keep the whole thing as an alphabet soup. You'll get lots of partial credit that way even if you mess up. Then for the very last step, show each number that you sub in and solve for the value of the variable the problem is asking for. This makes it much much easier for someone grading to follow what you did.",Chemistry

0x1961,"I would argue this phenomenon is the plate body behaving like a glider in the ground-effect region, and so extremely close to the ground, that viscous drag forces enter the system as well. \n\n(No particular order)\nEffect 1: as the plate approaches the floor at constant speed, the volume of air remaining below the plate diminishes linearly with the distance, so the exit-air‚Äôs volume flow rate should be constant over plate distance by this geometry. \n\nEffect 2: as the distance diminishes, the size of the escape windows for the air diminishes linearly. \n\nCombining 1 and 2, you have a constant volume flow rate getting restricted to a smaller and smaller conduit. The fluid speed tries to increase to maintain constant flow rate and constant plate speed, but this acceleration takes work. And the work done to accelerate the air is  coming from the plate‚Äôs downward kinetic energy. Therefore the plate slows down (at least in part) from this principle of needing to accelerate a fluid. \n\nEffect 3: when the plate gap gets quite small, there is now an exponentially increasing viscous drag impeding the air‚Äôs acceleration along the escape path. The air‚Äôs inability to get out fast enough causes a pressure rise, and the plate‚Äôs downward motion is decelerated even stronger now. Now it‚Äôs on a more pronounced ‚Äúair cushion‚Äù but time is limited before it runs out. \n\nEffect 4: For very light and very large plate, there exists a critical gap size where the rising air pressure is almost able to counter the weight of the plate. It appears floating, initial downward speed is gone, but a small downward speed is still required for the air‚Äôs pressure to remain high. Now that the plate‚Äôs weight is almost balanced, the motion from here forward is now roughly constant. The plate approaches the floor at a constant speed in this regime, where the work of gravity on the plate equals the work required to force the viscous air through this tiny gap. \n\nEffect 5: now the plate may have had some forward momentum! Or otherwise, with the plate in the floating regime, air might realistically leave faster on one side, giving the plate a tilt. Now it ‚Äúslides downhill‚Äù on this inclined air cushion. \n\nEffect 6: there now also exists some forward speed of the plate where the fresh air entering the leading edge of the gap is almost able to feed and sustain the air cushion indefinitely. The plate‚Äôs slow, constant descent onto the floor is now delayed even further by this \n\nIn all, the total combination of these effects can make falling, light, large plates stop descending, start sliding forward, and take a very unexpectedly long time to actually hit the floor and stop moving.",Physics

Most of general chemistry all the way through biochemistry deals with concentration and equilibrium, which typically deals with inverses and the relationship between variables and concentrations. This will help you see how some of the concepts are derived and will give you a better idea of how to solve any problem in any context.",Chemistry

0x4be,"Disease is a big factor. New strains of viruses and bacteria appear (or change in frequency) every year, making pathogen-resistance alleles come and go as well, almost like yearly fashion trends.\n\nThere are planktonic animals that make resting stages (e.g. eggs) that sink to the bottom of the pond and can stay in suspended animations for several years. In [one classic study](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06291), old resting stages of *Daphnia* (along with their pathogens) were dug out of the mud and reanimated. This is basically like using a time machine to hop back and forth and systematically cross-expose parasites and hosts from different time periods. One cool result was that the pathogens tended to be more able to infect *Daphnia* from the same year, showing that pathogens evolve to become especially good at infecting whatever genotypes are in the host population at the moment.\n\nWeather is another big factor. For species that reproduce fast, it can even change the population within a single year. There's a really cool study system of wild fruit flies in orchards in North America. The researchers working in the orchards have shown that allele frequencies change every year from spring to fall, as the weather becomes warmer and warmer, favoring genotypes that are good at living in warm conditions (the same alleles that are more common farther south, in fact). Then winter comes, and the population is ""reset"" as genotypes that are good at handling cold become favored instead. So it's easy to see how warm years and cold years would have a similar effect.",Biology

0xfe6,"It's not a stupid question, just perhaps an uncomfortable one to consider.\n\nThe answer boils down to ""yes, but..."". Just as we have bred various animals for specific tasks, we could hypothetically breed ourselves for increased strength and durability, or for some other goal. If we can turn wild steppe horses into massive Clydesdales and speedy Arabians, or take grey wolves and turn them into mastiffs and chihuahuas, we can certainly do similar things to ourselves.\n\nThe thing is, though, such changes come with trade-offs. A growing body only has so many resources at its disposal, and sinking those resources into one organ or function takes them away from somewhere else. We humans dump a lot of resources into our huge brains, for example, at the cost of a lot of other things compared to other animals; it's just that our brains provide such a massive advantage that it's worth it.\n\nAnother thing to consider: I think it's in the final episode, but at some point Nolan tells Mark that Viltrumite genetics are so pure that Mark's basically fully-Viltrumite; Mark only inherited a few superficial genes from his human mother. That's not how things work; to a biologist, ""genetically pure"" actually means ""*super* inbred"". \n\nA lot of domestic animal breeds have health problems, especially pure-breds. Not only are pure-breds usually very inbred, but if they've been bred for specific purposes, they tend to be very good at that but worse at other things. If we started breeding humans specifically for strength and durability, or speed, or intelligence, or *whatever*, you're automatically limiting your potential gene-pool, and humans already have quite low genetic diversity compared to other species. Your super-strong humans are probably going to start developing other problems within a few generations, like heart defects or being more prone to cancer. Maybe your super man will be as swole as a gorilla, but he's going to look like a Hapsburg.",Biology

0x2367,"There's no sterile neutrino that's been discovered. When physicists talk about how we *know* the universe works, there's three active neutrinos and no steriles. There's always searches for new physics going on, and people look in the most likely places (whether that seems most likely because of theory, or because of data).\n\nThere are unexplained experimental signals from two experiments, LSND and MiniBooNE that could both be simultaneously explained by a sterile neutrino at around 1eV^2. This was far from enough for physicists to consider it a discovery, but it's a very, very good reason to do experiments to clarify.\n\nPhysicists don't consider the sterile neutrino to exist, it's considered a plausible hypothetical.\n\nBut the LSND-MiniBooNE data exist. It shows something not understood that needs to be. Part of the reason that LSND and MiniBooNE together is compelling is that they're almost  completely different in the way they work, they're completely different types of neutrino source, detector and interaction physics. It's weird that two experiments that were so different came out with results consistent with the same hypothetical particle (although they are not the only experiments in the world, and if you start combining everything in the world that could theoretically see that particle it gets less convincing).\n\nMicroBooNE was made to be a *lot* like MiniBooNE. It's using the same neutrino source, it's in almost exactly the same place (geographically, they're right next to each other, for physics purposes they're at almost the same distance from the source). MiniBooNE had a weakness - it was not good at telling the difference between electrons and photons. MicroBooNE was designed to be able to do that. So the analyses that were released look for the MiniBooNE event excess either as plausibly coming from electrons or from photons. The analyses that have been shown aren't explicitly stating ""does a sterile neutrino exist"", they're saying ""do we see the same excess as MiniBooNE"", somewhat agnostic to whatever the underlying reason for the excess is. If it's electrons, that's exciting and evidence that goes towards there being a sterile neutrino. If it's photons, that's less exciting and goes toward the idea a background at MiniBooNE was modelled inaccurately. What MicroBooNE actually saw was neither of those things - that the MiniBooNE signal didn't show up at all (at a pretty mediocre statistical signifiance, enough to say ""probably"" but not enough to rule anything out). But if that's true, there's got to be another reason. 3+1 (adding one sterile to the known three active neutrinos) is what experimental physicists talk about because it's the least you have to mess with the model to make it fit the data from these specific experiments. Theoretical physicists talk about a *lot* more things, because they're looking at *theories* that make sense, not just trying to make their data fit.\n\nSo, this is a negative result. It's not a particularly conclusive one, but it is an important one. It's interesting, it's told us a lot, but I probably wouldn't go so far as to say ""heralds new chapter in physics"". Something is going on with the LSND-MiniBooNE signal. MicroBooNE not seeing makes it weirder - which could be physics that is even more exotic (or, in the worst case could be that MiniBooNE and LSND somehow both screwed up in entirely different ways that were somehow very consistent). But there's a strong experimental program under construction to iron this out (or possibly just make the puzzle more confusing). You should look forward to more updates - and understand that there's not just a new fundamental particle every few years: physicists are looking for how the universe works, but they don't get to decide how the universe works, only where are the best places to look for something new. And this is still a great place to look, even given the negative results presented this week.",Physics

If we do find it, the relevant language will be invented then and there.\n\nIt is for something I plan to work on, but life outside of Earth is 100% fact, we cant argue against that.\n\n>It's true that we'd have to make up a lot of new taxonomy, though. Life on Earth can be divided into domains and kingdoms and so on, but those are all based on sharing a single common ancestry. If we find something on another planet that looks a lot like a bacterium, but we can show that it didn't evolve from the same ancestor as our bacteria, we can't formally call it a bacterium. It has to be put into a brand new domain that's specific to that planet.\n\n>If, in a hypothetical future, we've found life on four or five different worlds, each of them appears to have emerged separately (not from some kind of panspermia event), and all life on each respective planet shares a common local ancestor (as is the case on Earth), that means you have one evolutionary tree of life per planet. So ""tree of life"" basically becomes a new taxonomic level above domain. Currently we have no need for such a taxonomic level, because it's a category with a single representative (Earth life).\n\nMy point is that humans dont share a common ancestor, we evolved from ourselves, but we have two forms, our ancestors (Very similar to primates, but not decended to them) and our pre ancestors ( our old form, in our old planet, we would have to scrap many things to presume How we lived and were, my hyphotesis is that we behaved like robotic psychics, we were telepaths, used the Power of our minds to do tasks and processses, constantly changing our environment. We probably didnt have emotions, didnt move, were giants, like towers, and I dont even know if we did procreate).\n\nAnd I even claim that our pre ancestor side is regenerating with time, this is why we dont look like animals anymore and became more rational.\n\n\nTaxonomy is a actually something much more complicated, in some cases, like us, you have to show the multiple Nature while maybe at the same time showing their percentages, it should be something like chemistry, where the nomenclatures are all complex and sophisticated.",Biology

It would also require simulating any emotional feelings, separate from standard inputs like sight, sound, touch, taste, temperature, etc.  All environmental variables would need to be simultaneously processed, respective to their constant changes.  Empathy requires the kind of math quantum computers were built for.  Most of the same kinds of mental skills would be required when imagining a complex mechanical device in action, with all of it's moving parts, friction heat, outside influences, and any other variables.  For the same reasons it would also apply to complex chemical reactions or visualizing complex physics.  Or you can imagine choosing the most efficient route for a package in a large shipping company, with all of it's ever moving planes, trains, trucks, personnel, etc.  The variables are constantly changing, therefore, the package's route is ever changing.\nThis would be different, however, than someone who memorized fixed mathematical rules to solve a complex linear or singular type equation.

0x1339,"Well if you are getting 1000 ppm O2 within a minute, you either have a fairly big leak or your O2 sensor has gone bad. Or both. The classic test for the sensor is to open up some diethylzinc in the box and see if it smokes (indicating O2 > \~10 ppm). I am hesitant to recommend this, because if that 1000 ppm is real you will coat everything in the box with zinc oxide dust (and maybe start a fire). You could maybe do a ketyl test if you have the reagents. If you have a spare O2 sensor, I would go ahead and replace the current one and see what happens.\n\nA few questions: did you turn off the gas circulation before opening the MeI, and did you purge thoroughly after it was re-sealed? MeI is going to absolutely wreck the box catalyst if you are not careful. The O2 sensor may also be sensitive to MeI - those sensors typically have a lifetime of 6 months - 2 years, but they have somewhat sensitive surfaces that can be poisoned by exposure to certain chemicals.\n\nFinal question: is the H2O also shooting up, or is it just the O2? If it is both, that points to a leak, but if it is just O2, I would suspect the sensor.",Chemistry

For the record, I have a M.S. in chemistry and the idea of a shorter PhD sounds appealing to me, especially given that I just entered my 30s. I look at various places and wonder how hard it would be to make this happen. For the record, I am interested in Eth Zurich, schools in Germany and the UK, and am passionate about organic chemistry and multi-step synthesis. I have been in industry for a few years after obtaining my master's, however I have no publications, at least, the material may not be published for a few more years (my former advisor is slow to publish and has a record of taking 5 years after graduation to publish a work). I am curious if anyone has ever made that leap from the States to Europeans schools. I have seen a number of fantastic professors that have interesting research that I would love to apply to be a PhD student in their labs, however I am unsure of the tenability, especially in terms of pre-earmarked budget, cost of living, expenses, resident requirements, resident requirements/fees, taxes, and even covid regulations. I am also unsure of what work culture is like in Europe. I have heard hear-say that Germany and Switzerland have student unions to push back on advisors and their requirements for PhD students to work 50-80 hours a week; that the work life balance for PhD candidates is actually a lot better than in the US. That sounds like a dream and another motivating factor that makes me interested.
  \n
  \nHas anyone made that leap? If so, would you care to comment? Should I just reach out to random graduate students/advisors and ask them about their research or does it just seem like such a pie-in the sky question to ask that a graduate student or advisor may even chuckle at my inquiry?",Chemistry

If you genuinely like and are good at chemistry, you memorize a few things and then problem solve the rest.  Look into organic chemistry.  It‚Äôs very puzzle-like.  I took like 70 hours of chemistry as an undergrad- it‚Äôs far more applied than memorization.\n\nGranted, I‚Äôm now transitioning over to computational chemistry after doing an organic chemistry PhD and 4 years of medicinal chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry, so take that with whatever grain of salt you want.\n\nThe one thing I‚Äôll say is that unlike in school, where you‚Äôre applying known things to answer questions, chemistry bench research is far slower.  It‚Äôs much less obvious what you should be doing and when you go wrong, it‚Äôs much less obvious why.  This gets way better as you become better, but the turn around time from asking the question to figuring out it‚Äôs not working to figuring out why it‚Äôs not working is far slower than in programming.\n\nIn programming, if you can design a solution in your head, there‚Äôs almost always a way to do it with enough work.  You also get fast feedback when your code doesn‚Äôt work, and even suggestions on where exactly that error is.

0x1022,"This is a hard problem to answer precisely. It is sometimes called the protein folding problem. However, there are physical tendencies and regularities that can be used for understanding.\n\nFirst and probably easiest regularity is that the core of a protein (the part not exposed to the water solvent) is predominately hydrophobic. One way to think of it is that water don‚Äôt want those aliphatic chains messing with the nice hydrogen bonds, so amino acids like leucine, iso-leucine, methionine, phenylalanine are pushed away from contact with water. \n\nConversely many polar amino acids, like glutamate, lysine, end up at the exterior of the protein in contact with the water solvent.\n\nMinor note, there are membrane proteins that cross cell membranes. These membranes are hydrophobic in nature, and in those cases the regularities above are inverted. But I limit myself to discuss proteins that are mostly in contact with water inside and outside cells.\n\nHowever, the backbone of a protein contains polar groups. It can be attractive sometimes to bury a polar amino acid side-chain in the core too, and to bind with the buried polar groups. For reasons I will not get into here, buried hydrogen bonds can be very strong. If you find a protein with a buried hydrogen bond, you can expect that to be an important bond to stability or possibly function of said protein. Sometimes you can even have buried ‚Äúsalt bridges‚Äù where a negatively charged side-chain (like glutamate) is interacting with a positively charged side-chain (like lysine), and those will be quite strong.\n\nThere are a few special-case amino acids. Proline for example has an odd structure in that its side-chain binds to the backbone twice, not just to the alpha-carbon. Proline tends to ‚Äúbend‚Äù the backbone differently from other amino acids. Therefore if you have one or several nearby prolines in the sequence, that very likely corresponds to a place where the protein forms a loop in terms of its tertiary structure.\n\nAnother special case is glycine, since it lacks a side-chain entirely. That leads to a more flexible backbone. \n\nAnother special case is histidine. This is an amino acid that has a pKa close to physiological pH. That means that by modest changes to the environment, this amino acid can flip between uncharged to charged. You can think of histidine as a way to functionally encode a pH switch. That means histidines tend to show up in places where some such functionality is needed. Great example is the FcRn binding of antibodies.\n\nAnother special case is cystine. This is the only amino acid that can form a covalent bond between side-chains. So called sulphur bridges can form between pairs of cystine side-chains. Covalent bonds are strong and add a great deal to protein stability. So again, if you see cystine amino acids in the sequence, they are often going to become part of sulphur bridges with other cystine amino acids in the sequence of with other chains in a quaternary structure.\n\nA key point in all this is that the tertiary structure is determined by interactions between pairs (or higher) of amino acids. You can therefore never fully say what one particular amino acid side-chain will end up in the tertiary structure. You can say some things to be more or less likely based on the regularities above. However, to say anything with more certainty requires more careful analysis. \n\nLet me take one special observed regularity. The so called [leucine zipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine_zipper) is a motif wherein leucine appears at every seventh sequence position for some stretch. This can be explained as it leads to very favourable dimerization of two helices such that the leucine side-chains ‚Äúzip up‚Äù very well together (recall they are highly hydrophobic). So if you happen to see a handful of leucine amino acids spaced seven positions apart in the sequence, you might guess that‚Äôs going to be part of a tertiary (or quaternary) structure of a leucine zipper.\n\nThere are other such regularities. However, they are rarely perfect and rarely sufficient to figure out tertiary structures from sequence alone. For that you need to consider more relations that are more complex that these types of rules-of-thumb I‚Äôve outlined above. \n\nIt is also noteworthy that for most proteins, their tertiary structure is stable under single mutations (say you replace one amino acid with another). So again one single amino acid side-chain change often (not always) does not change the higher-order structure. Some tertiary structures are extremely stable under most mutations. The [immunoglobulin domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain) is a good example of a higher-order protein structure that appears in many quite distinct proteins, and nowadays one can predict if a sequence will form such a structure pretty well because of certain highly conserved features in the sequence.\n\nAnyways, this can go on for long, and structural biology is the place to study this in more detail. Your teacher‚Äôs hesitancy to provide details is understandable since it is not an easy problem with a big body of research literature and without simple or certain rules if you go beyond the most basic regularities.",Biology

I'm of the opinion that there is a lot of overlap between the ""woo-woo"" (a pejorative of which I only recently learned the meaning) and whatever you want to call the weird interdisciplinary junction of all legitimate fields that would be required to give an empirical description of consciousness. I don't think it's unreasonable to think the Buddhists got a lot of things right, or that psychedelics offer an incredible opportunity to learn how consciousness operates. There's plenty of research from a variety of academic fields that supports claims of this sort.\n\nNeuroscientists, (bio)physicists, and mathematicians can get along well enough to create a healthy discursive space, but when you add philosophers (or even worse, psychonauts...or the worst: psychonaut philosophers) into the mix, the company grows cold.

Wouldn't it alter the results?\n\nWe can measure them, but it doesn't alter the result. Beta decay is a stochastic event. How long a neutron has existed in the past does not effect the probability that a neutron decays in the future. A free neutron that has existed for an hour has the exact same probability to undergo decay as a free neutron that has existed for a second. However, most free neutrons will never make it to that one hour mark before decaying.",Physics

0x17f1,"OP: Please allow me to restate your query: What is the essential role of CO2 in aerobic organisms (including humans)? Good question! Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled.

Already that means you lifting the grease away from the surface. \n\nCompare that to a caustic cleaner which is trying to dissolve the grease layer from the top down, almost like sandpapering a surface.  The vinegar penetrating and lifting can allow you to mechanically scrape up chunks instead of dealing with a corrosive mess of liquid, similar to a paint stripper.\n\nDropping the pH will protonate any fatty acids and triglyerides from their ionic form into a neutral non-ionic form.  That also helps break up the grease layer. \n\nCommercial oven cleaner is often a mix of caustic soda and an organic amine penetrating chemical.  Best of both worlds, it penetrates to lift from the surface, plus its cuastic to start dissolving from the top down.\n\nDistilled white vinegar is fantastic at polishing mirrors, glass, counter tops and handrails because it doesn't leave any residue.

If you shine some radiation on a sample it wont homogenously effect each bit of DNA the same and many will go unscathed.\n\nAt that some modifications of DNA are going to be much more detrimental to DNA binding than others. Add in the fact that theres varying binding specificity and your enzyme you pick will matter. Some are super specific and wont bind if theres a change while others will bind to anything resembling DNA.\n\nTo have enough radiation to confidentally effect every bit of DNA in a nanoparticle youll also be messing up the tissue that its in. Proteins will also be messed up in the process for instance.\n\nIf the DNA containing lipid nanoparticles were separate from the tissue/enzyme to begin with and you treated it to a prolonged exposure to radiation before adding the nanoparticles to a culture/reaction  mix then sure tho,Biology

And since all leptons and quarks have a weak interaction (or a component with a weak interaction) it has very weird consequences with how particles gain mass.\n\nIn principle a particle could have multiple effects that give mass and they'd just add up to the physical mass that we observe. And there is one super simple way to add a mass term to the Lagrangian (the Lagrangian allows you to then calculate how stuff moves and interacts and stuff). You just write m \* psibar \* psi where psi and psibar are the fermion and its antiparticle in question and m is some free parameter that is the particle's mass. But because all those fermions interact with a field that picks out the left handed side, such a term is forbidden. Peter Higgs, and others, realized the solution to this: let every fermion couple to a new field and then let this field be non-zero everywhere. This gives something that is equivalent to the above mass term in every way, but also respects the left handedness of particles. This is known as electroweak symmetry breaking and over the last decade has been confirmed to be how reality works.\n\nWith neutrinos its even weirder, but I'm getting pretty far off point.",Physics

0x248c,"Any virus will be under selection for higher transmissibility / infectivity. Not because of any ""want"", natural selection doesn't require desires. Most viruses have relatively high mutation rates, and while the vast majority of these mutations will be harmful to viral replication, some may improve transmission. Thanks to high replication rates in hosts (ofther factors being equal), any variants with higher transmissibility will quickly come to dominate the viral population.\n\nUntil recent decades, it was believed that viruses were under selection for *less* virulence (which FYI, means ""disease severity or lethality""), because a virus that rapidly kills or incapacitates its hosts will encounter fewer hosts to infect. For example the 1918 H1N1 influenza was remarkable for being rapidly lethal in susceptible hosts, with some infected with severe disease going from asymptomatic to dead in under a day. This actually hindered its spread, as the infected had only a very brief window of time to spread the disease. It perhaps should come as no surprise that modern relatives of H1N1 are far less virulent.\n\nHowever, there are some important exceptions. If a virus is normally transmitted in a pre-symptomatic stage of infection, there will be little selection for less virulence. For transmission, it wont matter much if all infected drop dead if there are many days in which hosts are infections and in contact with others.\n\nAnd if a virus relies on the same mechanism for both transmissibility and virulence, then the positive selection for transmissibility can entail some selection for higher virulence. For example, the binding affinity of the SARS CoV-2 spike protein for host ACE receptors has effects both on lowering the effective infectious dose / inoculum (thus increasing  transmissibility), as well as increasing the rate of viral replication within hosts, plausibly leading to viral replication outpacing host immune response. The Delta variant has nearly doubled transmissibility compared to wild type, and somewhat higher virulence in some host age groups. Here, its possible that the expected selection for higher transmissibility is also bringing some selection for higher virulence.",Biology

0x1118,"I think the word you're looking for is altruism, and act of compassion towards another unrelated organism with little to no regard for the risk to oneself or compensation of such an act. In humans it is evident, although there is an ongoing debate on whether an act can be truly altruistic given that, on a subconscious level, it is almost exclusively beneficial to be compassionate towards others, that is in most circumstances being kind to others earns us positive endorphins, a feeling of satisfaction when you help someone you don't know, which is the pinnacle of evolution in social animals. We are hard wired to sacrifice for others due to the parent-offspring bond which is so strong it extends to other potentially unrelated people and even other species. The same can be said for cetaceans, which are not far behind us in terms of social evolution. Although they may not be aware, or even capable of being aware of a potential payoff for helping a distressed swimmer at their own risk (although they likely do have these cognitive capabilites, at least where it concerns helping unrelated members of their own species), their social cognition is also hard wired to aid conspecifics and other creatures (humans, seals, other whales) based on their cognitively advanced awareness of present danger and the panicked behaviour of the organism in distress. Again, the payoff is positive endorphins rather than, let's say, the abstract idea of ""I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine"". I'm not sure this meta study has been done, but I would hypothesise that the greater sociality of a species, the greater frequency of acts deemed to be altruistic will be seen in that species, which simply means the more social an animal is, the more it will behave in a selfless manner towards non-related organisms. But again, there is a reward whether you're aware of it or not, that being positive endorphins. One is certainly aware of the positive effect these endorphins have on the body and mind, and being aware of this benefit thus calls into question the ""selfless"" nature of putting yourself at risk for others.

It's hard to say what pressures we place on the space of ideas we have about the world without being able to examine things from a nonhuman perspective.

That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end.

Surely some (arguably most; yes condensed matter I'm looking at you! :) dynamics are emergent though.\n\nIn any case, even if there is an underlying system I guess what I'm trying to articulate is that the principles of that underlying system don't need to be elegant, or even integrated into a single cohesive model.

It's easiest to understand ""the concentration of water in water"" using mass % or volume %. Two solutions of distilled water are each 100% water, so the concentration in each is just... 100%, by mass or volume. It might be a little counterintuitive because you're used to considering the concentration of something else, like salt or sugar, in water. But if two solutions are both pure water, then their concentration of water is the same.\n\nAs for your second point, I really hate the way people explain diffusion in school, and it tripped me up for a while too. The better way to understand diffusion is like this: there's no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration. Each molecule is moving completely randomly, bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors. It doesn't know what a ""concentration"" is, and it doesn't care. But if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like this:\n\n    A            |           B\n     x  x x  x   |            \n      x x x x x  |        x   \n    x  xx  xx x  |\n\nWhich is more likely: that any one of the 15 Xs crammed into side A will hit the membrane and cross into side B, or that the one lonely little X on side B will find its way to side A? Clearly, there are more Xs on side A, so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side B. And we say that the solution diffuses into side B, though each molecule in it is moving completely randomly.\n\nWhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other, they're still moving around just as fast, but now there's an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction. So we say our net diffusion is zero, even though the molecules are crossing the boundary at the same rate.",Biology

That will be the Limit of Detection (LOD) which is the smallest amount of acetic acid you can detect.\n\nSecond is repeatability.  Take a big bottle of any type of acorbic acid at any concentration (but relevant to your experiment is best).  Homogenize it.  Split it into 10 equal or at least known masses.  Do the titration on those 10 samples and make a results table (include all results, even outliers).  Determine the standard deviation.  That's your experimental error.\n\nPotential error in your experiment is cleanliness.  Have you calibrated the DCPIP concentration with another known standard?  Are you maybe washing the DCPIP burette with water and subtly changing the concentration each time?  Ascorbic acid can oxidize in the air so you need to keep solutions stoppered and don't take hours to do the test.\n\nThe titration end point is very sharp, it's easy to overshoot.  You should ideally be using about 10-15 mL of DCPIP solution in a pH 3 buffer.

The main idea is summed up by Dehaene as:\n\n> When we say that we are aware of a certain piece of information, what we mean is just this: the information has entered into a specific storage area that makes it available to the rest of the brain. Among the millions of mental representations that constantly crisscross our brains in an unconscious manner, one is selected because of its relevance to our present goals. Consciousness makes it globally available to all our high-level decision systems. We possess a mental router, an evolved architecture for extracting relevant information and dispatching it.\n\n> ‚Ä¶According to this theory, consciousness is just brain-wide information sharing. Whatever we become conscious of, we can hold it in our mind long after the corresponding stimulation has disappeared from the outside world. That‚Äôs because our brain has brought it into the workspace, which maintains it independently of the time and place at which we first perceived it.",Biology

0xf1,"Came here to say mostly the same thing you did, but your part 3 did give me an idea. If we could utilize reverse transcriptase to make an mRNA vaccine that inserted the spike protein code into our genetic code, then our cells could regularly produce antigens, possibly acting as our own ""passive boosters"" to viruses. Now, yes there are a lot of specific nuances to this idea, but that's what research is for, right? Some issues to consider: how to ensure that the new antigen gene gets put in a safe spot of our genome (not splitting important genes); ensuring regular but not too active transcription; would it lead to a sort of ""tolerance"" to the antigen, causing our bodies to no longer react to the antigen. Probably much easier said than done, but hey, it's an idea.",Biology

0x99f,"Great question!  It does in fact take more power to maintain a constant acceleration at increasing speed.   You can manipulate basic equations around to come up with P = F x V which clearly jibes perfectly with your observation that KE is exponentially increasing with constant acceleration.   So how do you explain a rocket, is it getting free energy (or free power) from a constant thrust force?  The answer is no of course, so what‚Äôs actually happening?   At the instant you light the engine, the power put into the rocket is zero because it‚Äôs velocity is zero.   All of the energy actually went into the exhaust gasses moving downward at high speed.  (You can check your instincts about zero power going into the rocket here by asking what would happen if it stayed bolted to the ground).   Then as the rocket accelerates more and more of the power goes into feeding its KE and less and less goes into the downward velocity of the exhaust.   Keep in mind we‚Äôre not doing relativity here, so from a stationary vantage point, with constant rocket acceleration you see each progressive bit of rocket exhaust coming out with a slower and slower absolute downward velocity.  It has less and less power going into it, which cancels with the rocket‚Äôs increasing power given by F x V.",Physics

0x24ff,"Part answer to your question: there's so much chemistry we don't know of the first 92 elements. Elements which are actually pretty stable, can be made and quantified and studied far more easily.\n\nThe biggest issue with heavy elements is radioactivity and rarity. Rarity makes them expensive. Radioactivity makes them difficult to use from a chemistry perspective. If you make an Es complex, it will only stay an Es complex for as long as the isotope exists. When that's on the order of seconds, microseconds etc, it's basically impossible to isolate it as a compound.\n\nIf you cannot isolate it as a compound, it's difficult to study.\n\nAnd there's the more practical reason, if you cannot isolate it, can you really call it a ""useful"" product.\n\nThinking of the economics of chemistry, what industrial process wants to use a very rare, very expensive element that decays over a matter of seconds in their chemical process.\n\nSo the applications aren't there, so the funding isn't there, so chemists don't study it.\n\nPhysicists on the other hand love heavy elements, because they care about fundamental processes. A chemist cares a lot more about ""what can I do with it"", and for heavy metals, the answer is, not a lot.",Chemistry

But ok: if flights start to be priced including the cost of energy for CO2 recovery from high altitudes, maybe prices will become realistic and people will fly less anyway.\n\nBut for airplanes it is not just that: they deposit the CO2 at high altitudes, where it remains for a longer time with a multiplied warming effect of a ton at ground level [by a factor of 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231020305689?via%3Dihub \n).

This term is, in fact, hard to calculate and depends on things that we can't yet probe. But it doesn't matter because there's another contribution from GR. This one is an integration constant. That is, it is a free parameter not predicted by anything. So the observed number is the number from QFT plus the number from GR. You can see that it doesn't matter what the QFT number is since you can get to any possible observed number by changing the number from GR to match.\n\nNow someone familiar with this topic knows that I have swept a big elephant under the rug. The numbers in question are a bit silly. The number from QFT seems to be something in the range of 10^120 times the measured value. So the GR number has to be 1-10^120 in the same units. Now, there's no problem with it being negative, but some physicists are surprised that these two seemingly unconnected areas of physics have two numbers that are so closely related.

You could argue that CO2 capture technology and companies are bad because they might enable fossil fuel use rather than switching over to renewables, so that the government wouldn‚Äôt pass legislation that reduced fossil fuel consumption. On a practical level, this type of argument is a reasonable concern, and I think that it‚Äôs important to keep in the public discourse around carbon capture. At the same time, direct air capture had the potential to be so valuable in terms of removing historic CO2 emissions that I don‚Äôt think we should just ignore it because of its potential to be misused. Another nice side effect of CO2 capture technology is that many of the materials useful for carbon capture are similar to materials used to capture pollutants or toxic elements both from gas streams and water, and these types of small molecule adsorbents might prove to be very good for human and environmental health.",Physics

0x18c1,"Well, the cell will either be transfected or lysed. \n\nTransfection: the virus injects its DNA into the cell, and has its DNA incorporated into the cell. From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the ""right time"", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\n\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\n\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome. This is not only true for our genome, but true for the genome of virtually every known organism. Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x). Some researchers actually once produced a corrective mutation in one of the dysfunctional viruses in our genomes, and it started producing viruses again. If I'm not mistaken, there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses, such as in organ transplant. Organ transplant from other organisms for humans is best with pigs, but researchers are actually working to purge some pig genomes of these failed viruses because they result in compatibility issues when trying to transplant them into our own bodies.",Biology

0x1b70,"OP: Please allow me to restate your query: What is the essential role of CO2 in aerobic organisms (including humans)? Good question! Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled. There are more details to this, but this is the essence of what would happen, none of it good.",Biology

So, while observing that both archaea and bacteria use all twenty may show that at least LUCA used these twenty amino acids, that all viruses also use them suggests a far more primitive, probably pre-cellular adoption to the twenty amino acids.\n\nSomeone could argue that it's possible that all megataxonomies of viruses only adopted the standard twenty after LUCA and only later evolved towards the current system as a result of evolution. So, while it seems quite implausible, the argument may go that it is at least *possible* this doesn't prove viruses indicate an earlier origins of the twenty amino acids than LUCA. But it turns out that LUCAs own genome is filled with viruses that used the standard twenty amino acids. So LUCAs own virome helps confirm an earlier origins of the twenty.

It's easiest to understand ""the concentration of water in water"" using mass % or volume %. Two solutions of distilled water are each 100% water, so the concentration in each is just... 100%, by mass or volume. It might be a little counterintuitive because you're used to considering the concentration of something else, like salt or sugar, in water. But if two solutions are both pure water, then their concentration of water is the same.\n\nAs for your second point, I really hate the way people explain diffusion in school, and it tripped me up for a while too. The better way to understand diffusion is like this: there's no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration. Each molecule is moving completely randomly, bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors. It doesn't know what a ""concentration"" is, and it doesn't care. But if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like this:\n\n    A            |           B\n     x  x x  x   |            \n      x x x x x  |        x   \n    x  xx  xx x  |\n\nWhich is more likely: that any one of the 15 Xs crammed into side A will hit the membrane and cross into side B, or that the one lonely little X on side B will find its way to side A? Clearly, there are more Xs on side A, so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side B. And we say that the solution diffuses into side B, though each molecule in it is moving completely randomly.\n\nWhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other, they're still moving around just as fast, but now there's an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction. So we say our net diffusion is zero, even though the molecules are crossing the boundary at the same rate.",Biology

This *usually* does not produce a well-rounded, coherent theory with a multitude of new predictions that fits neatly into all observed models (for a converse example, see general relativity, which did this perfectly). \n\nA solution to the horizon problem which I *wouldn't* consider ""hack-ish"" is one that has some kind of underlying conceptual impetus for *why* another ad-hoc scalar quantum field is a sensible addition to our universal framework, akin to *why* space-time is a sensible view of the universe. This is admittedly phiosophical, and I am not suggesting that inflaton fields or the higgs boson are bad physics - obviously they are far from it. Instead I am suggesting that these models hint at a deeper narrative we haven't grasped and that is reflected in their simplicity and disjointedness.",Physics

0x651,"My lab was not the most smelly lab in the world. We did not make any iffy 'fine' organic synthesis. Just a bunch of chemicals, and nothing really exotic.\n\nWe had piperidine, and tetrahydropyrimidine, both smelled somewhere on the bad side of the spectrum. Can't speak much about thiophenol - it was contained safely in a well-corked vial with several layers of polyetylene zip-bags, inside a glass bottle, and all in the fridge at +3 celsius. Whoever had packed it so well was clearly not intended to open it anytime soon.\n\nOxygen compounds have rather pleasant smell - methyl-tert-butyl ether, methyl-isobutyl ketone, 2-hexanone (methyl-butyl ketone). Furfural and furane and tetrahydrofurane (however the last one is borderline pleasant). Monoethanolamine is another one which is at the same time good and bad.\n\nDimethylsulphide is probably bad but we had it very diluted (somewhat 0.1% mass in propane). Dibuthylsulphide, on another hand, we had as a pure substance - and it is not pleasant at all, just believe me.\n\nBut the worst one was not the pure substance but the industrial byproduct (or, rather, residue). A greedy client hired us to determine what good - if any - contain his residues. It were residuals from olefine production, and from that fact you may tell they smelled horribly. He basically had a dozen of railroad tanks of that shit. Lighter products contained mostly butadienes (from which the 1,2-butadiene was the major one, defying thermodynamics), and the rest was a cocktail from hell - butyne-1, butyne-2, vinylacetylene and products of their polymerization. (I learned from literature that vinylacetylene is not only prone to polymerization - but it performs it so eagerly that it often proceeds with explosion. Thankfully, we did not learned that from first-hand experience!). \n\nHeavier fraction was not any better. We analyzed it with the method ASTM D 6730 (with huge red remark that this metod was not developed to determination of composition of so miserable, bad-looking, skunk-smelling devil mixtures). Oh dear. The majority, turns out, was styrene - upto 30%, and it by itself is not the best thing to work - not only it smells horribly, it also may be referred as a liquified cancer.  The rest were various compounds of various degrees of unsaturation, partially polymerized, partially oxidated, and believe me, the entire chromatogram was something to see - and to stick labels to various peaks. The test method had the relative retention times for approx 500 compounds - we found them all (discovered by the way there are some incorrect peaks in the reference table), but we also had several dozens which we can't stick a label to. I still believe there were some compounds still unknown to humanity.",Chemistry

Now, the further Electromagnetic waves travel, the higher the redshift is measured with an ""infinite redshift"" at the event horizon of our observable universe. \n\nDoes that mean the wavelength of those photons approach 0 and wouldn't that also mean, that energy density decreases with time and distance , leading to the curvature of spacetime to ""flatten"", but since energy is always conserved, wouldn't that also mean that space seemingly increases?

0x1dfb,"As others have mentioned, the physical differences in scale often directly lead to differences in chemical properties. In general, as your volume goes up, the surface area/volume ratio of your container decreases, so there will be changes in any area-dependent processes (like heat exchange). Some processes that are fairly straightforward on the bench like filtration or evaporation can become much bigger headaches when scaled up. Something as simple as mixing might take hours instead of minutes- and if you have always mixed a solution for 10 minutes on the benchtop, you might get the nasty surprise that it isn't stable if you mix it for 3 hours.\n\nScale-up often also affects your equipment and the materials involved. You might mix something on the bench in a glass flask with a PTFE stirbar on a hotplate. In the plant, it might be done in a hot water jacketed stainless steel tank with an overhead blade mixer. All of the changes you make to scale up- more powerful mixers, bigger pumps, larger diameter pipes and hoses, can introduce unexpected effects into your system beyond just bigger scale. A big challenge with scaling up pharmaceuticals for instance is that any new material you introduce into the method that has the opportunity for product contact, particularly soft materials like hoses and gaskets, has the potential to leach into your product, or catalyze degradation, or otherwise do something bad that you never saw in the lab.",Chemistry

0x134e,"I have a question about hypothetical spacecraft trajectories between destinations in the solar system. I know that the most fuel efficient trajectory (ignoring gravity assists) between, say, Earth and Mars is a Hohmann transfer orbit. This involves accelerating along the starting orbit to raise the aphelion, which is timed to line up with the target in both space and time. Given our current propulsion technology, a Hohmann transfer or some similar variation is the only feasible trajectory.\n\nWith magic sci-fi engines that can output a high level of constant thrust indefinitely (like 1+ g's), such as the Epstein drive in *the Expanse*, the trajectory becomes a ""flip and burn"" scenario where the spacecraft accelerates toward the target for half the journey, then flips around to decelerate for the second half. Journeys take days rather than months, and the trajectory is nearly a straight line.\n\nThat was a rather long-winded introduction, but my question is the following - imagine a ship has an onboard fusion reactor which powers some form of highly efficient electric propulsion. This lets the ship accelerate essentially indefinitely, but only at a fraction of a g (let's say less than 1 m/s\^2 or even less). **What shape does the optimal trajectory become?** Gravity is no longer ""negligible"" as in the flip and burn scenario, but the journey would still be far faster than a traditional transfer orbit with just a single burn at the start and end.",Physics

You're fine to have your interests but people who understand physics grow tired of people saying these types of things because some physicist-turned-youtuber wants more views and says whatever will get him more attention. \n\n> So if there‚Äôs a whole dark sector of matter there‚Äôs chances here. \n\nNo. Physics is extraordinarily mathematical strict. There's not freedom to make up new nonsense. The usage of ""dark sector of invisible particles"" means something specific to physicists. A term like ""dark"" often means ""not interacting with light"" -- e.g. if you're not in the light you're in the dark. It's not dark in the ""black magic"" sense. ""Sector"" often refers to some subset of matter fields and their coupling to some other subset of force carrying fields and the ""group representations"" that describe their relations. A ""dark sector"" here would be described by very familiar mechanisms and math and just would be an addendum onto our normal standard model description. \n\nAn analogy to explain why people are annoyed by your comment would be putting together a puzzle. We have a lot of it figured out but there are a bunch of open chunks. We've checked all the pieces and none seem to fit. We figure we just lost them somewhere nearby. Since the table we're doing the puzzle on is a dark black Ikea table we just refer to missing pieces jokingly as ""the dark pieces."" \n\nThen somebody who watched a popsci video comes along and says ""maybe the dark pieces are our consciousnesses combining to block out each other's understanding of the puzzle."" Nope, just a normal misplaced puzzle piece.",Physics

Corona viruses in particular is one the body had poor memory for and your immunity will generally wane within 6 to 9 months of infection, just in time to pick it up again the next winter.  This is why those in high risk categories are getting booster shots for Covid 19 to boost that waning immunity.  Third is mutation, this is seen with the influenza virus most notably, hence the yearly flu vaccine where educated guesses are made to try and predict how it will mutate and then produce new vaccines on that prediction.

I could have gone straight from grad school to a physics postdoc that would have paid $60k-$70k, but that just isn't enough money to satisfy me. My area of study in physics didn't line up well with physics industry (read: semiconductors and solid-state). So I left physics and sold my skills to the highest bidder.\n\nBig tech and big finance understand that there are many people who graduate with STEM degrees who want to go into non-STEM industry to make more money. I knew very little finance coming into my current finance job, and on a day-to-day basis I use very little finance in my current finance job. Everything I use is something that I learned on the job. My company doesn't care. They hired me because I'm smart, and then they taught me all the finance that I needed to do my job.\n\nThose majors demonstrate that you are at least somewhat smart. If you're smart, and you can demonstrate this in an interview, and you have some basic programming skills, then you can get a decent finance job. If you want to go into tech instead then you need better than ""basic"" programming skills. Statistically speaking, big finance and big tech are where STEM majors go if they don't want to work in STEM but want to make the most money, which is why I keep mentioning those two fields.\n\nEDIT: grammar",Physics

0x5b4,"It‚Äôs unlikely we could have powered the initial industrial growth via renewable energy, and for the first 100 or so years we didn‚Äôt even have that much concern about human emissions causing the planet to warm. Obviously there were still serious issues associated with pollution and also the exploitation of workers and regions that produced oil. \n\nThat said, most of the historical emissions have been after sometime around 1950-1980 when people were already starting to worry about the impact of emissions on the earth‚Äôs temperature. In this sense, it is true that we chose to emit greenhouse gases over renewables because of a desire for growth and profit. I‚Äôm not sure how developed renewables were at the time, and clearly they were under developed because of a reliance on oil, but renewable energy and battery technology likely weren‚Äôt able to replace oil in the 70s or 80s because of how big of a head start oil had. If you look at solar, for example, NREL shows that IBM had one in the 1975 with around 22% efficiency, but the price in the 70s was way higher than it is now to the point where they couldn‚Äôt have replaced oil. It also wasn‚Äôt merely a profit thing because the high price is associated with a difficulty in manufacturing it in bulk. \n\nAll this aside, you don‚Äôt make a compelling case for why we shouldn‚Äôt try to capture CO2. Yes, we could have used renewables in the past to avoid CO2 emissions, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt try to capture CO2 with plants powered by renewables. Direct air capture from the atmosphere followed by sequestration is one of the few ways that we can reduce the CO2 that already has been emitted. Yes, we can use trees or other natural carbon capturing systems, but carbon capture materials can also play an important role in reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions. \n\nOne important issue with carbon capture and sequestration is that it is incredibly unprofitable (unlike what you said). You spend money capturing something from the atmosphere that is useful (you can burn it to generate energy) and then just bury it underground. You allude to how people want to profiteer off of carbon capture, and I agree with you related to things like capturing carbon from either a coal or natural gas plant and then burning it (this is currently done actually), or capturing it from the atmosphere and then burning it, but the only way carbon capture and sequestration would make you money would be if there were government incentives like a carbon tax or by the government just funding the operation of carbon capture plants.",Physics

0x26a9,"60 applications with 2 interviews is a very low success rate. There may be something systematic on your end that you're doing/not doing over your qualifications. A good CV and cover letter is an art, ideally you tailor each one to the job you are applying for.\n\nHiring managers can easily filter people out by who's paid attention when sending out CVs, the less generic the better, it's all about being memorable.\n\nMy advice, pick about 8 jobs you actually like, not just ""I'm applying because I need a job and have skills in chem"". Put the time and effort in to rewrite your CV, making sure to include key words listed on the job posting. Make sure to emphasise (key skill they are looking for) from X experience under the relevant experience. So before they call you to interview they don't have to spend any time thinking about whether your experience is relevant. Assume that the hiring manager is overworked. When you are done, you have EXACTLY 1 MINUTE to read your CV and decide whether you are a good candidate for the role. Best thing you can do is give the selection criteria to a friend and time how quickly they can tick off the key things the hiring people are looking for. (This is a true anecdote from a friend who does hiring for their company). \n\nMost people will filter you out at selection if you don't meet their entry criteria. If the general talent pool is applying with a master's or PhD, then you're probably not qualified for the role (not always the case, you can be overqualified too, some people don't want to hire a PhD when they could train a BSC to do the job for 5-10k less per year.\n\nEdit, sorry for formatting, mobile",Chemistry

Do you work through practice examples? If you have to do tests, do you work through practice tests? If you have to do essays, do you do practice essays?

In the UK, most universities would run study skills sessions for students, particularly in their first year: I don‚Äôt know if sessions like that are available in your institution.

0x1896,"Simply put, inertia is the tendency of an object to keep doing what it's doing. Newton's first law of motion is also called the law of inertia commonly said as ""an object in motion stays in motion, and an object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by an outside unbalanced force."" In classical mechanics, gravity is just another force so if the gravitational force isn't balanced out by some other force then the object will accelerate according to Newton's second law.\n\nYou can also think of inertia as related to mass. It is harder to slow down a train moving at 50 m/s than it is to slow down a ball of paper moving at 50 m/s. And an object moving 1000 km/s in deep space (i.e. away from the influence of other objects' gravity) will continue to move 1000 km/s in the same direction until something changes that. \n\nPhysicists sometimes distinguish between inertial mass and gravitational mass though experimentally they've always been measured to be the same thing. In this case, inertial mass is the mass you see in Newton's second law when written as F=ma and gravitational mass creating the gravitational potential in the equation U = -Gm/r. Inertial mass would relate a force on an object to its overall acceleration whereas gravitational mass determines how much gravity an object has. Though again as far as we can tell they're the same.\n\nInertia also increases without bound as you push an object closer and closer to the speed of light. In other words, it gets harder and harder to speed up an object as you push it closer and closer to the speed of light.\n\nA final note on inertia there's also rotational inertia, which is the rotational analog of mass. Something with a higher moment of inertia is both harder to start spinning and harder to stop spinning. Moment of inertia (the official name for rotational inertia) depends not only on the mass of the object but also the distribution of mass away from the axis of rotation. A simple demonstration to see this is to take a meterstick and twirl it around its center vs trying to twirl it with the same force about one end. It's a lot harder to sping around one end because the mass is on average further away from the axis of rotation.",Physics
0x110d,"Try ether with acetonitrile! Pentane and acetonitrile aren‚Äôt miscible. Generally, when choosing a solvent system, ensure they are miscible; there are plenty of miscibility charts available online. \nAlso it‚Äôs easier imo if you add the anti solvent to the scintillation vial before you add the dram (smaller) vial to it. And a final tip for this technique would be to avoid disturbing the vial while waiting for it to crystallize. \nThere are other techniques one can try too. You can cool a saturated solution or, as someone mentioned, carefully layer a solvent and anti-solvent (and, if you wish, cool it as well). And in case nobody has explicitly defined it, an antisolvent is a solvent that your compound isn‚Äôt soluble in. \nFinally make sure to give your crystals lots of encouragement; they need it to grow! :)",Chemistry

0x2533,"The answer to that is kind of complicated, I‚Äôm no expert but I‚Äôll do my best to explain. A ceramic is pretty much a 3-dimensional matrix material arranged in a graphitic-type structure. It is generally made of silica and/or carbon mostly but there are plenty of other things that could be inside - mostly inorganic stuff like metals. They have characteristics like no glass transition temperature (which can kind of be thought of as a melting temperature in a layman sense), brittleness (because the chemical structure is highly croslinked and there arent many ways for the molecule to move and deflect energy, so it will simply break instead), heat resistance, and chemical/corrosion resistance. Ceramics can be made in many different ways, but my favorite type of ceramics are polymer-derived ceramics. In this method, you can take a silica based polymer and you basically just heat it up. At first the polymer crosslinks into a 3d shape, locking the shape in place. Then it pyrolyzes, where the less stable molecular structures are broken apart and volatilize out of the material. At high temperatures (like 1300 C) the bonds between the atoms are breaking chaotically and rearranging, and you end up with these carbon-rich domains which are basically graphite (this process is called graphitization) and silica rich domains. There are ways you can control the morphology to dramatically improve certain mechanical properties, but that gets into some complicated stuff.\n\nOh, and Ill add that a cool thing about polymer derived ceramics is that you can 3d print them, which is SUPER valuable for making intricate geometries like rocket engine components.",Chemistry

It occurs after conjugation in some organisms, but conjugation is not necessary for plasmogamy, most organisms release spores or gametes into the environment therefore conjugation is mostly not required.\nKaryogamy is the fusion of the nucleus. In some organism karyogamy is quite delayed after plasmogamy such as in certain kinds of fungi.\nI hope this helps, you will get a much clearer idea of these if you choose to take biology in higher classes.

0x1ae0,"Short answer stick to cs and there are plenty of cs jobs in healthcare, unless you specifically want to go MD. \n\nChemistry or especiallh biology is, unfortunately still largely a black box and there's little logic behind any of them. There are, but ask around and most research got the result first then try to explain the logic behind it. The most math intensive thing in benchtop chemistry or biology is deriving ratios for buffer and REPEATING it many times. On top of that bio majors produces the most amount of graduates so you will be competing with these many fuckers for these kind of jobs. \n\n\nThe most mathy Chem class is, of course physical chem and unfortunately it's not there to guide chemical reaction designs yet. It's close I would assume but not there. People would rather swing up a round bottom flask in one hour than computationally investigate a reaction for two days. There's no doubt in silico drug design is a thing but it's not typically something you touch in undergrad, for reference my undergrad at gatech back in 2014 spent one semester of pchem in a 200 ppl class of quant Chem which I can safely say as someone got an A with 60% exam scores, nobody got what the heck was going on. Another semester is wasted in thermodynamics which became absolutely useless. \n\nBiology is even worse in terms of memorization. Ive done 300 level biochemistry and had became a ta in that course involuntarily in grad school and it's all about memorization of stupid cycles that nobody cares. At least you'd imagine they'd teach you how that cycle is logically discovered, but fuck no.\n\nAlso be warned a typical Chem or bio graduate has nothing to do with healthcare. The closest healthcare job you can get with a chem bs is some guy running hplc in hospitals, and for biology I can't see any. If you like drugs that much, at least try computational drug design. Synthetic chem is arguably an easy way to get into drug design but I don't see it fitting you at all, just find the synthetic Chem labs in your school and talk to the grad kids what they do.

0x1add,"There's a couple of reasons, first the common cold isn't a single virus, it's not even a single family of viruses so having immunity to one causal virus just reduces the number of common cold causing viruses that can infect you.  Another is that not all viruses are remembered equally.  Corona viruses in particular is one the body had poor memory for and your immunity will generally wane within 6 to 9 months of infection, just in time to pick it up again the next winter.  This is why those in high risk categories are getting booster shots for Covid 19 to boost that waning immunity.  Third is mutation, this is seen with the influenza virus most notably, hence the yearly flu vaccine where educated guesses are made to try and predict how it will mutate and then produce new vaccines on that prediction.  Fourth would be you're immune system is compromised, perhaps you were recovering from a severe illness or on immuno-suppressant or had viral infection, like measles, which wipes out your immune memory.",Biology

0x1667,"I found this on the World Wide Web:\n\nNo shape can ‚Äúamplify‚Äù sound.\n\nSound being a pressure wave in air, it has a fixed energy, which dissipates with distance from the source.\n\nIf you want to maximise the amount of that energy you capture, a parabolic dish can focus that energy down to a point, which has the effect of concentrating it there. The bigger the dish, the more energy it can redirect.\n\nIn reverse, a parabolic reflector can also create a ‚Äúbeam‚Äù of sound from a point source. This is not amplification, but it does optimise the energy that is there in a particular direction.\n\nAnother aspect is the efficiency of acoustic coupling. A vibrating membrane might have a certain power, but if it‚Äôs coupled poorly to the air, it won‚Äôt produce much sound. Certain shapes can vastly improve this efficiency. It does not ‚Äúamplify‚Äù, but it does make sure that what energy is there is transferred to the air efficiently. This is the purpose of horns such as on acoustic gramophone players, brass musical instruments, PA speakers, etc. The best shape is an exponential horn that forms a smooth impedance match between the original source of vibration and the air. Horns work either way around - as a receiver, the human ear is somewhat like a horn; many animals have very obviously horn-shaped ears which acts as a combined horn + parabolic reflector.\n\nby Graham Cox, BSc (hons) from University of East Anglia (1993)",Physics

0x88f,"I'm sure someone will write on a way cleaner way since i'm going from memory.  \nAll of them come from the 3 dimensional wave function, do note that the 3d z\^2 may also be written as 3d z\^2 - r\^2 (after all, you'll probably be solving it in spherical coordinates and later returning to cartesian coordinates). If you really want to know more specific details such as where do each wave function comes from and how to write them you'll have to look on a quantum mechanics books, the expressions can get quite extensive.   \nWith that in mind, the squares can be easilly associated with the probability densities (squared wave function), since that is what you'll be seeing the orbital plots, and with some (really large) degree of freedom of speech, try to imagine the xy, xz, zy as solutions where the variables are correlated, justifying the fact that is never purely in the x or y (and so on) axis. For the x\^2 - y\^2 think of them as a linear combination of non-correlated variables to form the general solution, thus the highest probability wont be on a region where the (x\^2 , y\^2) combination is at it's maximum but where either (x\^2 , 0) or (0, y\^2) is being maximized.   \nThe biggest problem with this analogy comes from the z\^2 - r\^2 one, here you'll need to have some revolution solids in mind, since it's quite easy to see that the density regions are separated by a 3-dimensional cone instead of a traditional cartesian axis, that's where the r\^2 may help to visualize its formation. Try plotting a surface such as z\^2 - x\^2 - y\^2 and note that the 3d z\^2 solution lies inside the cone and around it.   \nHowever, do realize, this is just an (way) overly simplified justification, you'll need to check the wavefunction solution for each case to really get a picture of whats going on behind the scene and it's now that hard to find a table of such solutions. I'm pretty sure you'll be able to check some of the formal definitions on a book such as Quantum Chemistry by Levine, they come mostly from working the Hydrogen Atom but there's plenty of nuances on its treatment and **i would not recommend taking my analogy on word alone**.",Chemistry
0x853,"First, the argument that they make is not the same as the argument you made (even if their conclusion is similar). They make no mention of the source of the CO2 emissions. They only refer to the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. At least they understand that what put the CO2 in the atmosphere doesn‚Äôt matter. Hopefully you finally agree with this after sharing this link?\n\nSecond, while their conclusion is that the theoretical limit costs more energy to capture carbon than was gained when it was emitted, this directly contradicts the claim made in one of the papers I sent above. That paper claimed that it is theoretically possible (based on thermodynamics) to use a fossil fuel energy source to capture carbon and still have net negative emissions. I‚Äôm more inclined to trust the analysis coming from people who specialize in the thermodynamics of gas separations and also who published it on a peer review journal than a post on someone‚Äôs substack, even if that person has a PhD in physics. It is possible, however, that the analysis from the 2005 paper represents a theoretical limit that cannot be reached. ‚ÄúEconomic and energetic analysis of capturing CO2 from ambient air‚Äù (which is cited in the blog post you sent) estimates that with a 5% second law efficiency (they note that real world processes typically have a 5-40% efficiency), the energy costs associated with capturing CO2 from the air is similar to the energy gained from natural gas. If a carbon capture technology were more efficient (and it is theoretically possible for it to be more efficient based on arguments in this same paper), then it would be feasible to power direct air capture with a natural gas plant and still have negative emissions, and if it were powered with renewables then it would be even better in terms of the CO2 reduction. \n\nUltimately, it is true that carbon capture is an energy intensive process. It is not, however, true that the relevant quantity to consider in evaluating the thermodynamics of carbon capture is the energy gained from the initial CO2 emissions. It just so happens that the actual thermodynamic process that is relevant (that of the adsorption and desorption of CO2, which is what I‚Äôve been saying all along) happens to give you a similar amount of energy required for capture as natural gas generates for the same amount of CO2 emitted if you assume that the process has a second law efficiency of 5%. There‚Äôs nothing saying the second law efficiency can‚Äôt be better than 5%, and also it doesn‚Äôt matter that a lot of historic emissions have been from sources besides natural gas (like coal) which emit more CO2 per unit of energy generated. In the argument you were making where the source mattered, these coal emissions would be relevant in addition to other sources. This might seem like a small point, but the main thing we have been discussing is what is the theoretical limit of CO2 capture and what is the relevant thermodynamic process to consider for it, and you were mistaken in thinking the initial emission process was relevant. Perhaps you think that the 5% second law efficiency won‚Äôt be bested, in which case the energy use for direct air capture would probably be prohibitive; this is a reasonable thing to believe, and it seems like there are people who are knowledgeable about gas separations who believe it, but it is very different from claiming that direct air capture could never be feasible because the thermodynamics of it could never be favorable. The fact that it could be feasible is why it is a very active topic of research.\n\nEdit: I was looking back through the DAC review article that I initially sent, and wanted to conclude with adding this quotation ‚ÄúLackner thus concluded that the potential for greater efficiencies with DAC closes the gap in energy requirements between the two processes and suggests that arguments of DAC being unfeasible due to large energy demands compared to flue gas capture may not be accurate.‚Äù In the paragraphs following this quotation, the review article discusses different argument made by different papers regarding the energy required in an actual material. They are not all on agreement, and the process is complicated enough that the various approaches from each paper often have drawbacks that could limit the accuracy of their estimates. Clearly, there is debate about the energy requirements of DAC. Some scientists/experts think it the technology won‚Äôt be able to get efficient enough, while others think that it can. I don‚Äôt think any of the experts think that it is thermodynamically impossible though, just that some think efficiencies might not be able to get close enough to the thermodynamic limit to make DAC reasonably cheap. Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn‚Äôt be feasible no matter how efficient it got.",Physics

The tetrahedron and a hexagonal thing. The hexagonal thing is not the simplest unit so it's pretty easy to see why that's not the unit cell. The tetrahedron I actually only see in your description and I'm reasonably certain the reason it doesn't work is that it does not contain enough information or atoms to rebuild the crystal structure. I'm actually not really seeing a tetrahedron. The best tetrahedron I can see is not regular by any stretch of the imagination and definitely won't tesselate to rebuild an entire crystal from that unit. Did you mean octahedron to include all the face centered atoms in the cubic crystal? The issue there is that if you tesselate the object, you'll skip a bunch of atoms. \n\nThe short answer would be that very smart people have worked on this for over a century and the cube is the simplest unit cell that can be tessellated to reproduce the entire crystal structure. If you have an alternate idea for the unit cell, I guarantee your missing something. You either will skip certain atoms when you tessellate, can't tessellate it at all, or you could create an alternate and simpler unit cell that will also work.",Chemistry

0x2411,"\> would that change what we think we know about evolution?'\n\nNot really. If a species finds a stable niche that doesn't entirely disappear during episodes of mass extinction, it can remain morphologically similar for hundreds of millions of years.\n\nMost selection, at most times, drives species to remain near their local optimum in the fitness landscape. This equilibrium is punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution when the environment changes dramatically and the selection pressures a species is subject to change, or in small isolated populations where genetic drift can mean a random walk across the fitness landscape.\n\nAnd even in species that seem morphologically similar to those that existed hundreds of million years ago, there can be substantial evolution. Most organisms are in a ""Red Queen's"" race with faster evolving parasites and pathogens, so even though their gross appearance may match an unchanging local optimum of the fitness landscape, they probably had major changes to immune response, which wouldn't be visible in the fossile record.\n\nMy understanding is that the nautiluses we find today are scarcely distinguishable from some nautiloids that existed prior to the end Permian mass extinction, and morphologically similar to nautiloids from 500 Mya. Some lampreys haven't changed much in 360 million years. If someday in the deep unexplored ocean some decendant of [*Anomalocaris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalocaris) was found, it would be the coolest thing, but it wouldn't change current evolutionary theory.",Biology

I‚Äôd be much more convinced about CSH if they‚Äôd refute the issues he brought up instead of ignore them. They‚Äôve been accused of the highest crime in academia, prove Hirsch wrong and sink him forever.\n\nThis is silly. It's not going to happen. Hirsch is not making any recognizable scientific claim: he's just saying ""fraud, they are jerks, I don't believe it, I think BCS is full of crap, blah, blah, blah"". You can't just say the right magic words and stun Hirsch into silence with the power of data. \n\nAnd you can't ""sink him"": I think his reputation is probably as low as can be in the actual community of active researchers. But there are channels like arxiv and non-peer-reviewed journals and r/physics where even cranks get heard.\n\nScience doesn't happen like a superhero flick where Galileo goes to the Pope and mutters ""eppur si muove"" and by the end of the movie scientific truth has triumphed and the Pope has to slink off, defeated. It's a bunch of people doing their own thing, some of which is absolute crap, almost all of which is borderline useless, and only a tiny bit of it makes a difference in the end.",Physics

0xc6e,"So it's a laymen's term and my apologies,  but I try not to get too far into minute details on reddit threads out of fear it won't be fully understood by everyone reading it.\n\nWhen vaccinated, your immune system is ""boosted"" - hence the term ""boost"" or ""booster"" for the vaccine. You get a ""surge"", rapid increase, peak, whatever you want to call it to have it make sense to you (as a virologist, immunologist, entomologist, a new worried father, what have you), shortly after your immune system is stimulated. You would therefore after a vaccination ""booster"" get a ""surge"" or sudden increase in circulating antibodies. In this case for a booster it would be IgG antibodies over IgM, or even in this specific case of a pregnant/post-partum/breast-feeding mother IgA antibodies as it's present in her bodily fluids, but I digress.\n\nThen after a period of time the antibodies go down to almost undetectable levels. There's vast variations in the populations and within individuals, so saying that they go to ""0"" is not entirely accurate. In this day and age with there being no herd immunity, vaccine hesitation and resistance, etc., it's quite possible any particular person may have some level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies circulating at any point in time. That's why there's ""baseline"" with testing depending on the type of test done and what has been used as a control to establish that test. I've worked in a variety of laboratories and for instance, there's one influenza variant, let's call it variant A, that if your antibody titer is 1:8 or higher, you are considered immune to that virus (1 portion of your serum had enough antibodies present to bind to virus when mixed with blood and diluted at a ratio of 1:8). But let's also say there's another influenza variant, called B, that's a bit more funky, so we consider a titer of 1:16 or 1:32 protective. Or better yet, it's an H5-based influenza virus, in which case it's highly debated if HAI testing is even a good determinant of protective antibody response at all.

Every day life is about electrons, photons, up quarks, down quarks, and gluons. You could maybe make a case to include muons\n\n>The search failed to find the particle, known as the sterile neutrino.\n\nokay, sort of true, but really they didn't test neutrino oscillations, they tested the MiniBooNE low energy excess and disfavored that at solid significance.\n\n> This will now direct physicists towards even more interesting theories to help explain how the Universe came to be.\n\nthis is just making things up.\n\n>That is because a sizeable proportion of physicists have been developing their theories on the basis that the existence of the sterile neutrino was a possibility. \n\nThis is highly misleading: this result does not rule out sterile neutrinos, nor does it rule 1 eV sterile neutrinos, rather it does not find evidence for the low energy excess that MiniBooNE saw which was often interpreted as evidence for a sterile neutrino. Sterile neutrinos could still exist at 1 eV but with smaller mixing with active neutrinos, or sterile neutrino could exist at any other mass range (likely heavier), or both. In fact, sterile neutrinos almost certainly exist somewhere, but they are very tricky to probe.\n\n>why the neutrino has such a tiny mass - which is what allows them to change flavour \n\nthe fact that their mass is tiny is not why they change flavor, rather the fact that they have different masses and that the weak interaction produces a combination of several different mass states.\n\n>its shadowy mirror-image anti-matter\n\nanti-matter is not shadowy; it interacts in essentially exactly the same way as regular matter.\n\n>That result was confirmed by a separate experiment tin 2002.\n\nthey can't even mention the experiment? The paragraph is ambiguous, but I assume from context that they are referring to SNO which measured solar neutrinos confirming the standard flavor-flipping (ugh, that sounds so stupid - why can't they call it oscillations?) not the LSND anomalous result.\n\n>They believed this form of the particle could explain the over-production of electron neutrinos and, crucially, give an insight into why the particles change flavour. \n\nA 1 eV sterile really doesn't explain why neutrinos oscillate in any particular way.\n\nThe article actually winds its way through the leptogenesis problem pretty well; implying a connection without out right saying it.

Metabolism is highly complex and involves many molecular conversions to produce various molecules the body might need at any one instance.  \n\nA scenario where glucose might be converted to fat is eating food when your body already has sufficient energy. If the body has sufficient energy, there is no reason to break it down further to produce energy. Instead, glucose can be converted into glycogen, which is a fuel-storage molecule. \n\nGlycogen stores are limited, but fat stores are virtually infinite, so if you overeat, your body tends to start producing fat stores.

I‚Äôm also familiar with safety data sheets and (in the UK the ‚ÄòControl of Substances Hazardous to Health‚Äô) from my time in labs. Solvents such as amyl acetate (one of the components) can attack some plastics, so probably that component leached through the plastic zip bag. The smell is quite penetrating, so that‚Äôs probably what you can smell. I doubt if you will have any adverse effects, as the double bagging would have reduced the amount of solvent escaping considerably. Some people can smell it at lower concentrations than others, but judging from your description it seems unlikely that you had a significant exposure. Faintly smelling it doesn‚Äôt sound to me to be a lot if exposure. You can google exposure limits of the different components you‚Äôll see in the safety data sheet for further information.\nKeep your closet door open, and open the window in that room for a while. The smell should slowly dissipate. If I were you, I would store solvents like that in your garage if you have one.

If we do find it, the relevant language will be invented then and there.\n\nIt's true that we'd have to make up a lot of new taxonomy, though. Life on Earth can be divided into domains and kingdoms and so on, but those are all based on sharing a single common ancestry. If we find something on another planet that looks a lot like a bacterium, but we can show that it didn't evolve from the same ancestor as our bacteria, we can't formally call it a bacterium. It has to be put into a brand new domain that's specific to that planet.\n\nIf, in a hypothetical future, we've found life on four or five different worlds, each of them appears to have emerged separately (not from some kind of panspermia event), and all life on each respective planet shares a common local ancestor (as is the case on Earth), that means you have one evolutionary tree of life per planet.

Using gloves only when they are necessary is more advisable I think (of course you need to know when you need them and learning to be aware of possible dangers is worth a lot). A lot of stuff in the lab, especially teaching labs, is not more dangerous than stuff that is commonly used at home, it is important to differentiate. Also if people wear gloves they tend to care a lot less if they spill something or not and if they do, they contaminate everything instead of cleaning the mess up immediately. Wearing gloves for a prolonged amount of time also causes sweating and opens the pores, which makes the exposure to chemicals even more dangerous and guess what, gloves also have a time limit on how long they guarantee to withstand different chemicals and people also tend to not care about that and wear gloves for hours.\n\nOf course I dont want to abolish gloves, but I think brainless overuse causes more harm, than it does good.

0x2342,"My brother is the nuclear engineer so I know more than the average chemist but I'm no expert. I'm still reasonably certain that this is wrong. You don't really input energy into a nuclear reactor. You have fuel rods that will always and constantly give off neutrons. You use neutron moderators, usually coolant as water, to thermalize the neutrons and slow them down. Slower neutrons are more likely to collide with uranium for more reactions. Then you use reflectors and absorbers like beryllium and boron, respectively, to control how many neutrons there are around the fuel rods. At no point did I have to input any energy to cause the uranium to decay and give off neutrons. It's just doing what it would do anyways, and I'm controlling it with external factors. \n\nSo from that standpoint, I think the key things for the chemistry of your fuel rods are factors like density of your actual fuel (ie crystal structure), it's propensity to form cracks during it's lifetime, thermal expansion, etc etc. Even if this couterion neutron capture is an issue, I think it would take a back seat to the other factors and be relatively minor.

If you get a green residue after the toluene evaporates, your atmosphere has only a few ppm of O2 at most and I would point to your O2 detector being the problem here.

I find it fascinating because everyone‚Äôs experience is unique but they all flow very similarly. Regardless of gender, race, location, culture, or creed - people have extremely similar ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù experiences when they experience an NDE or psychoactive compound. Whether it‚Äôs LSD where eyes are open, or DMT with closed eyes while seeing more vividly than ever imagined‚Ä¶the experiences are so strikingly similar. With DMT, why would people see the same ‚Äúentities‚Äù even if they‚Äôve never heard reference of them beforehand? I‚Äôm not saying that with DMT you go off on an astral trip and meet inter-dimensional beings. But what IS happening?

Well, we don‚Äôt really NEED to understand the why to see that it does, regardless of our understanding. But I do believe we will understand it better someday. Whatever it is, it IS scientific and it just IS the way things are. Either we as humans have the ability to hallucinate the same experiences and exact images as strangers across the globe, or it‚Äôs a spiritual experience suggesting that there is way more than just this earthly plane of existence.

Overall: the plastic has irreversibly lost a small part of itself but not enough to change the size of the brick.\n\nAdding peroxide + UV introduces more even stronger radicals - BAM! kick it up a notch.  They attack the yellow polymer only at the site that is missing a hydrogen atom and essentially chop it in half. No more yellow coloured molecule.\n\nDownside is the polymer is no longer elastic.  It's brittle.  What you un-intentionally end up doing is scraping off that tiny thin brittle layer to expose fresh plastic underneath.\n\nYou can repeat the process many times so long as you have material remaining.  It's almost exactly like sandpaper over a wooden floor to expose a fresh surface.  And yes, you can do it so many times but not infinite times.

A suspension is rarely the preferred formulation, but if the drug is not freely soluble in the liquid vehicle (preferred), then a suspension is the second choice. Nebulized corticosteroids are formulated like this because of their highly lipophilic nature.\n\nRegarding your second, recent question, I'm specifically avoiding saying yes or no because your question doesn't really describe what's happening in the body. The excipients are needed to create a delivery system for the drug, what happens when these tiny aggregates of drug/excipient/vehicle enter the body can vary according to the agents used, but yes, in most cases, a ""vitamin"" must separate from the excipients to become biologically active.

0x1731,"Many molecules have chains of atoms, including almost all organic compounds like gasoline, sugar, proteins, etc.  \nThe central atom concept applies to each of the atoms in the chain, as a way to explain their geometries. For example, the molecule acetic acid (the sour part of vinegar) is C2H4O2. On one of the C atoms there are three H atoms and then the next C along. The four bonds around that carbon predict a geometry where the angles are roughly 109.5 degrees- the ‚Äútetrahedral‚Äù shape. Then the other C has a three bonds: one from the first C, a (double) bond to one of the oxygen atoms, and a bond to the second oxygen. With three bonds we‚Äôll say the best geometry is planar, with the bonds at 120 degree angles. Finally that second oxygen has the bond to the H atom, plus non-bonding electron pairs.    \nSo even that simple molecule can be thought of as having 3 ‚Äúcentral‚Äù atoms.",Chemistry

Im not trying to be condescending but you would do yourself a huge favor by getting a better grasp on chemistry before trying to grasp molecular biology.  At this point you are asking things that are explained in middle school science classes before they even call the class chemistry, or at least my middle school called it Science class.  A gas has atoms less densely packed than a liquid or solid.  A nebulizer  uses an atomizer to disperse the drug and in turn and intrinsically turns it into a gas or at least decreases the droplet size small enough to be inhaled without choking.  The less mass something has the less effect gravity has on it.  Something under about 80nm is uneffected by gravity.  Although the droplets are larger than this they do have such little mass at those sizes that they are temporarily suspended in air.  This is essentially a fog not steam.  Of course steam is acting on similar principles and is also lifted into the air by thermodynamics. Speaking of your earlier example of liquids those are suspensions in liquids usually mostly water with some flavoring to make it easier to swallow whereas a nebulizer or inhaler is a suspension in air. Gases mix homogeneously without even mixing like a liquid.  At this point it is getting a bit difficult to explain to you because you are requiring an explanation of underpinnings that should be understood and implied.  Again see basic chemistry and physics.

0x2292,"Disagree. I'm not a knee-jerk anti-nuclear wingnut, but given the dramatic progress in intermittent renewables over the past decade, the use-case for nuclear is substantially smaller than many redditors seem to think it is. There's certainly a good case to be made for nuclear power for clean load-following or baseload electricity generation, but that's about it. My experience is mostly limited to American energy policy, but there's not much reason to believe other countries would have it substantially better when even the French nuclear industry is broadly declining.\n\nDue to the numerous safety regulations governing nuclear power plant construction, upkeep, and decommissioning (which, for the record, I think are a good thing), nuclear power plants are expensive as hell and take forever to build. kWh for kWh, they simply cannot compete economically with cheap silicon PV. Even if they could, a primarily nuclear energy industry would require new power plants being finished across the country every few days just to keep up with the rate at which they'd be decommissioned. Given how long they take to build, it's easy to see that the modern American nuclear industry is literally multiple orders of magnitude away from providing more than ancillary support to a broader green energy economy, powered primarily by solar and wind.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine a universe where investment in nuclear energy deployment continued apace for the past few decades, laying the foundation for a zero-carbon nuclear future.

0x2594,"So far people commenting are forgetting about *length contraction*: If I'm moving at relativistic speeds, in my reference frame the distance between where I start and where I end up shrinks. Time is still passing for me, but the distance I travel approaches zero as I get closer to the speed of light. At the speed of light, then, the distance *is* zero. Better, points at lightlike separation are a distance zero from each other in the Minkowski metric.\n\nThe implication that confuses the OP, then, is that this means that, in the reference frame of a photon, it exists for only an instant: It is instantaneously transmitted from its origin to its destination, and thus in its frame *no time passes*. In our frame of course it takes time for the light to move, because light doesn't move infinitely fast and the distance between its origin and its destination *isn't* zero. In the photon's frame that distance *is* zero. This is indeed strange, for it says that a photon ""sees"" the universe as flat, with all distances parallel to its direction of travel shrunk to zero; and as far as the photon is concerned it seems not to exist for any time at all.\n\nTo that all I can say is that photons aren't people; they seem to get along with their weird lives with little worry. I don't exactly want to make the excuse that I'm a physicist and not a philosopher, since understanding the ontology is important for the physics, but it is true that special relativity works.

0x1937,"Okay so this is a tough question, let me try to bring some light to it.\nSo, the issue here lies with the interpretation on Quantum Mechanics. QM postulates describe how do systems work. They are true (as far as we know), but they don't give a further explanation as to why is the world like this. These postulates describe how measurements are performed by an observer on a quantum system. The measurement collapses the wave function at the moment of the measurement. And the instants before and after the measurement, the system can go back to its usual probabilistic behaviour. However, what does it mean to perform a measurement? The measurement gives a concrete value to a magnitude (it could be energy, speed, position... of the system). Usually, we consider collisions between particles or semiparticles to be measurements, since, in the limit, they are two different systems that interact and preserve the energy and momentum equations(if they are coupled we cannot apply it but for the sake of our argument we'll toss it under the carpet). So, in these cases, even if there's no evident observer, there is indeed a measurement performed in the systems. \nThis means that you don't need to have intelligent observer to collapse a wavefunction.\n\nHowever, if we say the whole universe is a closed system that has a huuuuuge wave function, one could argue that there are only partial observations but the whole universe wavefunction isn't collapsed. Then, you could say that everything is in a quantum state and is in fact governed by qm laws as a wave. What happens with all the other possible discarded states (universes in this case) is a bigger question that has no answer and that messes with the interpretations of qm.\n\nTL;DR: we don't need intelligent observers to collapse wave functions, the universe is and will be a quantum state\n\nHope it was useful:)",Physics

0x17d7,"Thallium possesses several closed shells of d and f-electrons, but once they are completely filled they tend to become irrelevant. (hence the comparison of distance to xenon and radon is a bit inaccurate) A very important aspect is the inert pair effect of s-electrons. It simply states that as you go to higher rows, e. g within the 3rd main group from boron to aluminium to gallium to indium and finally to thallium, the s-electrons become increasingly more difficult to access. The effect originates from quantum mechanics. This means in essence that the tendency of being most stable in the +I compared to the +III state increases with increasing mass of the element. In other words, removing both s-electrons from the valence shell of thallium is more difficult than for indium, gallium, aluminium or boron. (The same trend applies also to the 4th and somewhat to the 5th main group) Negative oxidation states are for  elements of the 3rd main group exceedingly rare, because their electromegativities are relatively low. This means that the valence shell of thallium for example is barely capable of accommodating one additional electron. negatively charged thallium ions are therefore rarely formed.

0x20c0,"One should keep in mind that most dark matter ""alternatives"", including this one, actually include dark matter. It says so right on the 2nd page of their paper:\n\n> Consider requirement (iii), that is, successful cosmology. In (2) we have a new d.o.f. œÜ [...] What should the expectation for a cosmological evolution of œï be? The MOND law for galaxies is silent regarding this matter. There is, however, another empirical law which concerns cosmology: the existence of sizable amounts of energy density scaling precisely as a^(‚àí3).\n\nIn other words, they are saying that to get the cosmology right, they need to add dark matter -- that is what they are alluding to with the ""sizable amounts of energy"". They make their œÜ field play this role. It's just like TeVeS, the other major relativistic MOND theory, where the scalar ""S"" field does the same thing.\n\nThe popular press likes to frame the debate as ""dark matter vs. modified gravity"", but it's really ""dark matter vs. dark matter plus modified gravity"". The hope is that adding a modification of gravity will help fit the galaxy rotation curves better, at the cost of higher theoretical complexity. If you read the paper, the authors aren‚Äôt trying to do away with dark matter at all ‚Äî their primary achievement is getting their modified gravity theory to work out despite the many theoretical obstacles.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I also feel like I should respond to the other top comment which complains modifying gravity is ""less elegant"" than dark matter. These days, dark matter models are not about elegance at all, they're about minimality: trying to account for it by adding just one or two kinds of particles, with the simplest possible interactions, focusing on the dumbest possible first guess. There was an era where people to make dark matter ""elegantly"" fall out as a secondary consequence of adding 100 new particles in a grand theory that also solved every other problem in the Standard Model at once, but that ship has sailed because those theories didn't work. As scientists we should just follow the evidence, without theoretical prejudice. It just so happens that at the moment most of the evidence points towards dark matter.",Physics

0x1d6e,"Well, it depends on the situation. Generally I'd say the quote as stated is not wrong (it's imprecise, as it is a statement in words and not one in mathematics, but it's at least not wrong). \n\nThere are situations where a quantum system is in only one state. We might not know in what state it is, but it's definitely in one and only one state.\n\nIn other situations a quantum system can be in a superposition of multiple states (that can be all possible states, it can also be only two of many possible states). A superposition of multiple states is what popular science calls ""in many states at once"" (one can definitely discuss how accurate this description is, but I think it's the most accurate, non-mathematical, description one can give). If you measure such a superposition state you will however only observe one of the states that made up the superposition (much like the example of the cat, that's why I said: if a cat was a quantum system the example would be true).\n\nWhich of the two situations apply, depends on your experimental setup. The important thing is that the measurement statistics of these two situations are different. If you give me a quantum system, and don't tell me whether it's in one state (but don't tell me which) or whether it's in a superposition af multiple states, I will be able to tell. Sounds counter intuitive, but that's just because writing it out in words introduces imprecisions.",Physics

0x1f5c,"Okay that makes more sense to me. In that case, it's either a kinetic or thermodynamic thing. It's probably not kinetic but just in case, you could try cooling it more slowly. Idk what the water content is in the microwave so either inject it into hot water and let cool or let it cool and then inject it into the regular water. I don't think this will work but maybe.\n\nOtherwise, the issue seems to be one of partitioning. You have 2 phases, either stearic acid in the SLN or the lipid tails of the tween 20. As is, they are virtually identical. Both are totally unsaturated long carbon chains. Could you try altering composition of the lipid core to make a more distinct difference in phase? Clotrimazole is highly aromatic so while it will dissolve in aliphatic substances, it should still prefer aromatic substances. If you can up the aromatic content of your SLN, it might stay in place more. Aromatic body friendly things seem rare though. Cholesterols or some unsaturated fats maybe? Some vitamin B's or E look promising. Tryptophan might even work. \n\nCome to think of it, the whole thing is weird to me. It's a little weird that you have SLN's and micelles both existing. It seems like there's just too much surfactant as it means your covering the SLN's entirely and still have enough left over to be above the cmc. But the other bit that's weird is that a drug dissolved in a SOLID lipid core is partitioning into the micelle phase. If it's solid, it shouldn't really move and definitely not partition into a micelle phase. So... kinetics might not actually be far off. I was thinking of micelle formation before but you might need to worry about the SLN formation. If you can get the SLN's formed before diluting, you should be golden. But I'm guessing that's the whole cold water step and it will fail otherwise. I'm kind of curious what happens if you just microwave the drug and stearic acid by themselves and then inject them straight into water. It will fall out of solution, but if it forms the right sized particles, you might be able to add your tween 20 after the fact and with some mixing and/or sonication, resuspend the stearic acid mixture. Even if you are forming micelles, it should be solid already and avoid the issue. But it might not form the right size particles or resist resuspension. Who knows?

The main idea is summed up by Dehaene as:\n\n> When we say that we are aware of a certain piece of information, what we mean is just this: the information has entered into a specific storage area that makes it available to the rest of the brain. Among the millions of mental representations that constantly crisscross our brains in an unconscious manner, one is selected because of its relevance to our present goals. Consciousness makes it globally available to all our high-level decision systems. We possess a mental router, an evolved architecture for extracting relevant information and dispatching it.\n\n> ‚Ä¶According to this theory, consciousness is just brain-wide information sharing.

From the creature's point of view, the object is not a collection of equal sides and angles, like a cube is supposed to be, but rather, the creature sees two differently sized squares linked together (just like a drawing of a cube).  \n\nLike the creature, we cannot see or comprehend a cube in the 4th dimension, but we can comprehend its shadow as projected onto our 3D world. A tesseract, as it's called, is simply a small cube centered within a larger cube with the vertices connected. From our perspective, the cubes are not equal sizes and the connection points are not equal to the sides of the squares, but regardless of our perception, it is a perfectly equilateral object in the 4th dimension, and each face is its own cube. We know this because, in order to create a 4th dimensional cube (tesseract), you would have to take 3D cubes and seperate them equally across a brand new direction, one that does not exist in our reality (just like ""up"" and ""down"" are brand new directions that do not exist in the reality of the Flat Worlder).\n\nMy point is, a virtual reality experience of the 4th dimension would still be grounded in the 3rd, because that's all we can experience.

In this metaphor, there is no such thing as a consciousness particle or consciousness field but rather it emerges when you reach some critical threshold of interacting neurons.\n\nHe also uses some subtle arguments relating to the trade offs between a given force (gravity, EM) and its reach of influence. If a consciousness force could affect the brain, it would have to be certainly much stronger than gravity and we‚Äôve never detected such a force.\n\nI do agree this is likely beyond his field of expertise, but I don‚Äôt fault him (or anyone) for positing claims beyond their strict academic domain.",Biology

Beyond these very high level qualitative explanations that re-emission happens, you can also look at a physical chemistry textbook or a solid state physics textbook for a discussion of the interaction between photons and vibrational modes.

Your DNA is inside the nucleus of the cell and whenever something needs to be expressed, a copy of the DNA is made and then transported out of the nucleus. When it's transported out, it's the mRNA form. It's the same here, except being made in the cell's nucleus, it's introduced via a shot. As far as I know, it's the same mechanism that stops excessive expression.\n\nHmm.. so I'm not an expert, but this doesnt sound right. the mRNA isn't anything but a message for your body. Your body uses that message to produce proteins that the rest of your body will then fight off. I think the concern is that there's no way to control the amount of proteins your body creates so SOME people create a massive amount of proteins which end up collecting in certain parts of the body. \n\nWhat is ""excessive expression""?\n\n>There's nothing to support that.

If this isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre saying, then I just misunderstood, but as far as I‚Äôm aware, I don‚Äôt think that this is right. \n\nFirst, over time we have been gradually getting more energy for the amount of emissions that are produced. Natural gas flue streams have much less CO2 than coal streams, making carbon capture from them more difficult (you allude to this in your comment above), but also meaning that we could be getting more energy per emissions out of natural gas than coal. I don‚Äôt know if the natural gas gives less energy than coal so it balances out to be the same energy per emissions (if so, I would be interested in seeing a source on this). Also, either way I agree we shouldn‚Äôt be using fossil fuels for energy. I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúclean coal‚Äù or natural gas advocate. \n\nSecond, different materials require different energy inputs to adsorb and to release CO2. It‚Äôs not a fixed cost for every material. I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm missing some basic thermodynamic argument for why the energy cost to capture must equal the energy cost to release, because we aren‚Äôt trying to ‚Äúunburn the coal.‚Äù Initially we had coal -> energy and CO2, but now we are trying to go from CO2 -> something that isn‚Äôt coal.

I would assume he knows this, but what it boils down to really is how much contact you have with people, which he isn't saying.\n\n>The mRNA gets replicated in the cell's cytoplasm/ribosome. Your DNA is inside the nucleus of the cell and whenever something needs to be expressed, a copy of the DNA is made and then transported out of the nucleus. When it's transported out, it's the mRNA form. It's the same here, except being made in the cell's nucleus, it's introduced via a shot. As far as I know, it's the same mechanism that stops excessive expression.\n\nHmm.. so I'm not an expert, but this doesnt sound right. the mRNA isn't anything but a message for your body. Your body uses that message to produce proteins that the rest of your body will then fight off. I think the concern is that there's no way to control the amount of proteins your body creates so SOME people create a massive amount of proteins which end up collecting in certain parts of the body. \n\nWhat is ""excessive expression""?\n\n>There's nothing to support that. Nothing scientific, not even theoretical. There is a bad flu going around this year, that's true though.\n\nI agree.

It is different from other meal moth species, including the common meal moth, Pyralis farinalis. Adults are tricolored above, wavy patterned below, and with the tiny abdomen tip held at about 90 degrees to body plane. Now pantropical (and in warm temperate regions), it may have originated in Central America.\n\nTheir diet is unusually broad, including grains and many foods made with at least some grain including cereals, breads, muffins, pasta, pet food, bird seed, but apparently also some nuts, candy bars, peanut butter, possibly starches such as corn starch, tapioca, etc.\n\nThe peak adult activity is around dusk. During daytime the adults mostly remain inactive in dark spots (e.g. crevices). Adults are moderately attracted to light, especially in the blue to violet range.\n\nThey are readily detectable using pheremone traps (scented tent-traps). Deter them by using airtight, adequate  food containers or double bagging, as well as using essential oils and nontoxic pantry moth spray. All stages including eggs are readily killed in a short time by temperatures over c. 130¬∞F (e.g. in a car in the sun on a hot day) or freezing for 72 hours.\n\nUnlike most meal moths, the larvae of this species readily chew through paper, some plastics including processed-cereal freshness liners, and even thin cardboard. Double-bagging with Ziplock bags is normally adequate unless populations are large. Tupperware style containers only work if they completely seal (""airtight""). Put open food away promptly and avoid leaving pet food out more than a day or two.\n\nEdit: typos",Biology

0x98b,"1.The fact that he's young and healthy doesn't necessarily mean COVID won't hit him hard. Plus, the more people are vaccinated the better because the virus won't be able to transmit so easily, replicate and MUTATE. So we are more likely to get worse COVID variants if there are not enough people vaccinated. Not to mention there's a higher chance that he will spread it to his grandma or something. \n\n2. I honestly can't think how you can hit an artery in the upper arm muscle? Or even a major blood vessel.   But let's assume the vaccine goes straight into the blood stream. Nano-lipid particles are quite fragile. They're often covered in PEG to even make them stay longer in the bloodstream otherwise they would get opsonised and eaten by macrophages quickly. In order for these nano-lipids to ""enter every cell of the body"" they would have to extravasate from the blood stream and that wouldn't be so easy either (not to mention there wouldn't be enough of them to enter every cell). Usually people rely on cancer vasculature to be more ""leaky"" and try to use liposomes as drug carriers for instance. Because they would in theory accumulate in tumour. Probably the worst case scenario if by some miracle you injected the vaccine into the bloodstream would be that you might not develop an immunological memory for COVID or feel a bit worse. Even if mRNA entered some other cells, they would just start producing this spike protein. And sure, the immune cells would destroy these ""infected"" cells but there's nowhere near enough mRNA injected to cause any real damage that way (especially if it's dispersed and ""diluted"" in your body in this scenario). So essentially in the muscle the cells will start producing the spike protein (which is not secretory because some people wrongly suggest that you have a lot of this protein accumulated in your body), the immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) would find it, carry it to lymph nodes and activate T cells and B cells. There are a lot of DCs in the muscle so it's a great place to inject a vaccine. \n\n3. I honestly can't see how an mRNA vaccine can mess up your immune system and make it not work properly. It just mimicks what happens in any other viral infection. Your friend's argument is sooo general it's annoying. If he told you a suggested mechanism of action of this, then we can discuss. But like this? He should provide a source with a proof of that. \n\n4. Some people already answered. I don't really know the history of mRNA vaccine clinical trials so I won't say much. But let's not forget some companies didn't manage to make good mRNA vaccines for COVID (and tried), and that a lot of money and effort from thousands of scientist went to make these vaccines work. That for sure played a part in this success. \n\n5. I really don't like anegdotal evidence. What does it mean he ""measured""? Did this doctor actually designed a study and properly measured a correlation between a vaccination and all these diseases? And published it? If not, then his words don't mean anything.",Biology

And how do you fight off cells with COVID?  Your immune system!

0x20d4,"I think the emergent property argument, at least as I‚Äôve heard Sean Carroll say in other contexts, is something similar to how physicists view emergent properties in statistical mechanics. That is to say, there is no such thing as the temperature of a single atom, nor the pressure of a single atom, but rather these macroscopic properties (of a gas, say) can be very accurately modeled as emerging from the many trillions of well-understood kinetic collisions of those atoms. In this metaphor, there is no such thing as a consciousness particle or consciousness field but rather it emerges when you reach some critical threshold of interacting neurons.\n\nHe also uses some subtle arguments relating to the trade offs between a given force (gravity, EM) and its reach of influence. If a consciousness force could affect the brain, it would have to be certainly much stronger than gravity and we‚Äôve never detected such a force.\n\nI do agree this is likely beyond his field of expertise, but I don‚Äôt fault him (or anyone) for positing claims beyond their strict academic domain.",Biology

The numbering follows the one of Fischer's projections, being 1-sn the carbon at the top and 3-sn the one at the bottom.\n\nThe advantage of this particular notation is that the spatial configuration (D or L) of the glycero-molecule is determined intuitively by the residues on the positions sn-1 and sn-3.\n\nFor example sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid and sn-glycero-1-phosphoric acid are enantiomers.\n\nMost vegetable oils have unsaturated fatty acids in the sn-2 position, with saturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or 3-sn position.[5] Animal fats more often have saturated fatty acids in the 2-sn, with unsaturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or sn3 position.[5]",Chemistry

0xaf3,"My knowledge of the nutrition literature is very sketchy further back than the year 2000.\n\nThe 9 essential amino acids were known by the 1940s. Its the same 9 essential amino acids for humans, cows, chickens, and *all* animals. No animal is an essential amino acid producer, they're all ""middlemen"". In evolution, creatures that evolved to eat plants or other animals lost the same set of metabolic pathways early, over 1000 million years ago.\n\nNutritional requirements for protein have become better defined with time. I'd recommend the WHO's [Protein and Amino Acid Requirements in Human Nutrition](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43411/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf;jsessionid=42513E10FE32E690D087BCDF2725806C?sequence=1), from 2007, for the still current consensus.\n\nThe requirements are fairly fixed by lean body mass, and its still common for some elderly to fall short, mostly because they're sedentary and eat so few calories in total that the dietary proportions that served them in youth no longer provide enough protein to support immune function. There's no requirement for the elderly to consume animal products, but for those who consume fewer calories in total, the requirement for protein may rise from the \~10% of calories required in younger people to 15-20% of calories. The additional protein could come from eggs & cheese, or from legumes and tofu.\n\nThere was an [interesting paper from 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155041311400062X) which found mild protein restriction was associated with protection against chronic disease and mortality, but only up to age 65 to 70. After that, higher protein intake in the 10-20% range improved survival. I think in this study we're seeing both some benefit from mild protein restriction in preventing cardiovascular and metabolic disease in middle age, and also a benefit of ensuring enough protein for our immune cells to proliferate in response to infection, in the elderly.\n\nI eat a plant based diet for health, and became fascinated with the nutrition and health literature about a decade ago. Because plant based diets can be unbalanced, I was concerned about the essential amino acids likely to be deficient. The key requirement for  is 30 mg/kg/day of lysine, and 15 mg/kg/day for methionine + cysteine (from table 49 of the WHO document cited above). Meet those, and its pretty much assured the other essential amino acids will be adequate. In practice, it generally means most plant based eaters need 2-3 servings of legumes daily, to ensure adequate lysine. People with weirder diets, like alcoholics, may need more protein heavy foods.",Biology

When they find one they like, they'll bury them and pat them down.\n\nIf you feel like harvesting them, the next step is drying them.   Then put them in water and trashing the ones that float or the ones that have tiny holes in them (bugs).  Then you crack them open, trash bad ones, and crush them.  I soak them in a bowl and change the water at first 2-3x/day, and stop once I'm changing the water once every 3 days.  Basically go until you leech out most of the tannins and they're not bitter anymore.\n\nIn the end, \~1/2 the acorns you'd pick up and even consider are bad.",Biology

Oxidation is always accompanied by reduction,  giving oxidation-reduction, or redox, reactions. Many metals are oxidized by O2, acids, and salts. The redox reactions between metals and acids as well as those between metals  and salts are called displacement reactions.

CONCENTRATIONS OF SOLUTIONS (SECTION ", "Chemistry"
""," The concentration of a solution expresses the amount of a solute dissolved in the  solution. One of the common ways to express the concentration of a  solute is in terms of molarity. The molarity of a solution is the number  of moles of solute per liter of solution. Molarity makes it possible to  interconvert solution volume and number of moles of solute. If the  solute is a liquid, its density can be used in molarity calculations to  convert between mass, volume, and moles. Solutions of known molarity can be formed either by weighing out the solute and diluting it  to a known volume or by the dilution of a more concentrated solution  of known concentration (a stock solution). Adding solvent to the  solution (the process of dilution) decreases the concentration of the  solute without changing the number of moles of solute in the solution 1Mconc * Vconc = Mdil * Vdil2.

Another friend of yours in the same biochemistry class says  that salting out works because the incoming ions adsorb  tightly to the protein, making ion pairs on the protein surface, which end up giving the protein a zero net charge in  water and therefore leading to precipitation.
